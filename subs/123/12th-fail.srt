1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,916
This is Chambal.

4
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,958
Yes, that one, notorious for bandits.

5
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:57,625
And this small village
is called Bilgaon.

6
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:03,083
And this fellow sitting on the roof
is Manoj.

7
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,333
And very soon he's going to decide...

8
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:10,208
"I'll pass India's toughest exam,
and become a senior police officer,

9
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:12,916
"and clean up the country of corruption."

10
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,041
Look at the irony!

11
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:22,833
He's busy making chits
to pass his finals - cheating.

12
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:30,083
Anyway, let me begin this true story

13
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:34,708
on the day Manoj's father
was suspended from work.

14
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:40,583
"I won't accept defeat,
I'm not that easy to beat..."

15
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,583
What did you think?

16
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,041
You insult Mr. Chauhan
and walk off scot-free?

17
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,791
What has he done now?

18
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,166
Didn't he tell you?

19
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,125
He's been suspended.

20
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,083
I'm here with the suspension letter.

21
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,041
I won't accept it.

22
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,666
-It's official. You have no choice.
-You can't force me.

23
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:06,833
Ramveer, don't talk to him like that.
He's our guest.

24
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,958
Come, son. Give it to me.

25
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,333
Here.

26
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,500
Kamlesh! Get your grandfather's rifle.

27
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,500
This bastard thinks
he can suspend my son!

28
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,916
Please, Grandma!
I'm just doing my duty.

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,708
Prepare to do God's duty instead.

30
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,333
How dare you suspend my son
without cause?

31
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,250
Please hear me out!

32
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,000
Out with it.

33
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,458
Talk!

34
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,625
Yesterday, Mr. Chauhan
called for Ramveer and asked...

35
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,250
Why haven't you signed
this seed-distribution file?

36
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,000
The farmers never got their seeds.

37
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,583
The Mayor siphoned them off.

38
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,625
So how can I sign your phoney claim?

39
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:51,166
How dare you accuse the Mayor?

40
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,791
Type up his suspension letter.

41
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,625
You crook! You and your Mayor
sell seeds on the black market.

42
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,375
You rob poor farmers
and I'm the one getting suspended?

43
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:05,750
-Mind your tongue!
-You mind my shoe!

44
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,000
This is the first time
someone's flung a shoe at Chauhan.

45
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,916
Here's the second time!

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,416
Type his suspension letter right now!

47
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,333
What do you say now, Grandma?

48
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,666
Can you imagine?
Hitting our boss with a shoe?

49
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,041
And twice?

50
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,083
Hey, Ramveer!

51
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,416
These thieves don't deserve a shoe.

52
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,750
They deserve a bullet.
Kamlesh, shoot him!

53
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,541
Have you gone mad?

54
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,458
-Leave me!
-Shut up. Don't interfere.

55
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,500
Blow his brains out.

56
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:44,833
-Grandma, the police!
-Let go of it.

57
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,875
What happened?

58
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,333
Grandma's gone berserk.
They shot at me!

59
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,083
Just stick the notice up!

60
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:57,083
Put it up!

61
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,458
Ramveer, don't spare these traitors.

62
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,333
Your father sacrificed his life
for the country.

63
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,708
Remember that.

64
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,000
Grandma's plan to send us to jail
was foolproof.

65
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,791
No one dares lay a finger on my son!

66
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,291
Nonsense like this
has gone to his head.

67
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:32,083
I've decided. I'll go to the High Court.

68
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,041
I won't spare them.

69
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,833
If you leave home,
how will we survive?

70
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:41,416
Don't you eye my pension.
I'm not giving you a rupee.

71
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,166
That pension is not just yours.
It's also his father's!

72
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,291
Don't worry, Ma.

73
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,666
I'll pass my school exams
and become an office boy.

74
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,083
Here you go.

75
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,958
How many chits did you write?

76
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,708
I have to pass this year.

77
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,291
With all these chits,
you'll be Chambal's top scorer!

78
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,708
Nice job, bro!

79
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,791
Listen carefully, you lot!

80
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,208
Tear up all your cheat sheets.

81
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,625
You idiots can't even copy
the answers right.

82
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,291
Remember last year?

83
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,416
Even though I let you cheat openly,

84
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,666
what happened?

85
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,791
175 out of 200 of you failed.

86
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,791
There's a new system this year.

87
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,416
I'll write all the answers on the board.

88
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,041
And you morons just copy them down.

89
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,416
-Fantastic system!
-The first answer...

90
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:48,458
x2-3x+2=4

91
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:52,041
x=x-1...

92
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,458
Oh, shit! We've had it!
The new Deputy is here.

93
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,666
Does that mean no cheating?

94
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,416
Nothing will happen.

95
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,666
What's going on here?

96
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,208
It's an age-old tradition, Deputy sir.

97
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,166
You are our esteemed guest. Welcome!

98
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,583
Can we talk in private?

99
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:28,916
This way...

100
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,791
Our Principal can handle him.

101
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,500
He'll fix it. Don't worry.

102
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,583
Please come.

103
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,375
What do you think, Deputy sir?

104
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,458
You think any of these dullards

105
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:49,541
can become engineers, doctors,
or officers like you?

106
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,208
Never.

107
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,166
Even if they studied day and night,
they'd never pass the 12th grade.

108
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,916
But with a little help from us,
they'll pass.

109
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,458
At least, they'd get a menial job.

110
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,291
So, you're doing a public service?

111
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,208
No, not me.

112
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,291
The Mayor. After all, it's his school.

113
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,666
And that's him calling.

114
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,166
Hello? Mayor sir?

115
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:25,250
Yes, DSP Dushyant is here.
Here, speak to him.

116
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,208
The Mayor.

117
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,416
You're making a mistake, DSP sir.

118
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,666
This is Chambal.

119
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,041
The kids of bandits study here too.

120
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:46,708
If one of their kids fail,

121
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,916
they'll burn your house down.

122
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,166
Never mind all that.

123
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,541
Do have a seat.

124
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,958
We were expecting you.

125
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:05,166
Here's something to sweeten your day.

126
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,541
Told you, he's a badass.

127
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,250
He fixed it.

128
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,416
Take a photo.

129
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:53,541
His son fails
and he doesn't give a damn.

130
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,083
No, he's off to the High Court
to reform the country!

131
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,916
So what if he failed?

132
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,666
The whole village failed.

133
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,291
He'll pass next year.

134
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,958
Exams aren't the Kumbh Mela
that they'll come once in 12 years.

135
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:10,125
Had he passed,
by now he'd be an office boy.

136
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,666
Now where will the money come from?

137
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,208
Your son is suspended.

138
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,500
Wherever it comes from,
it won't be from my pension.

139
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,916
Your son is abandoning us.

140
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,916
And you only care about your pension.

141
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,250
Do you even care about us?

142
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,125
I care about the whole country, Pushpa.

143
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,166
Please wait.

144
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,541
Let me go.

145
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,916
Let me fight.

146
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,458
You'll fight on an empty stomach?

147
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,958
No vegetables today?

148
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,666
Close your eyes, Ma.

149
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,625
Where the hell were you?

150
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,208
Why are you hitting us?

151
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,250
Your father's gone.

152
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,958
You weren't even home
to say goodbye to him.

153
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,291
Close your eyes, Ma.

154
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,291
-Why?
-Go on!

155
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,916
Just close them!

156
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,583
Now open them.

157
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,083
Where's this from?

158
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,291
Our troubles are over.

159
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,500
-We are earning now.
-How?

160
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,500
We're running
a makeshift rickshaw service.

161
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,708
I'm the driver. And he's my assistant.

162
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,958
I'm glad your grandfather died
in the war,

163
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,833
or he would've died of shame.

164
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,250
Rickshaw drivers!

165
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,458
It's great fun, Grandma.

166
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,083
All I have to do is shout,

167
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:31,250
Morena-Jaura-Bilgaon.

168
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,875
Amidst flora and fauna,
our next stop is Jaura!

169
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,625
Amidst flora and fauna,
our next stop is Jaura!

170
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,958
Amidst flora and fauna,
our next stop is Jaura!

171
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,541
Where are you going?

172
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,166
-No rickshaws beyond this point.
-Says who?

173
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,833
Are you new?

174
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,291
It's the rule.

175
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,541
Whose rule?

176
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,416
The government's? Or the Mayor's?

177
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:04,833
Same thing, kiddo.

178
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,541
The Mayor's bus never runs empty.
Get off.

179
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,916
But there's no room in your bus.

180
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,583
Shall I make room?

181
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,666
Driver saheb! Make some room.

182
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,458
[In the service of people]

183
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,416
There! It's done.

184
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,833
Move it! Don't waste my time.

185
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,750
Let's go.

186
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,666
Let go of my passenger.

187
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,500
Do you know who owns that bus?

188
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,041
I'm not scared of anyone.

189
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,708
You'll end up dead.

190
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,833
You won't listen to me?

191
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:53,083
This is the first time anyone has hit
the Mayor's man with a shoe.

192
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,208
Here's the second time!

193
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,708
You're a dead man now.

194
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,083
Start the engine.

195
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,833
How much did we make today?

196
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,875
44 rupees.

197
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,583
Let's buy ten rupees of sweets for Ma.

198
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,583
She'll be so happy.

199
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,916
Hey, what's that?

200
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,125
Stop, stop!

201
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,208
Hey, get down.

202
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,208
-Go, sit in that bus.
-What's the problem, sir?

203
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,250
-Why are you getting off? Wait.
-Sit in that bus.

204
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,791
-What's the matter?
-Sit in that bus.

205
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,250
You'll find out in a minute.

206
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,041
-Make it quick.
-We've done nothing wrong.

207
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,500
Take them to the police station!

208
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,750
-Police station?
-What did we do?

209
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,541
I'll tell you what you've done.

210
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:40,916
Arrest them!

211
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:46,958
In you go!

212
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,333
-Is that him?
-Yes, sir.

213
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,458
-He's the Mayor's man.
-Shut up!

214
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,083
I get it. You're all the Mayor's cronies.

215
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,250
That uniform lets you do as you please?

216
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,500
Hot-blooded like his father.

217
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:10,125
Like father, like son. Morons!

218
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,041
-Don't insult my father!
-Or what will you do?

219
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,083
Speak up!

220
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,416
-I'll shoot you with my Grandpa's rifle.
-Really? Go on then.

221
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,958
Go. Get your Grandpa's rifle.

222
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:26,500
Either you shoot me tonight,
or I'll shoot your brother tonight.

223
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,041
Go.

224
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,958
Get the rifle.

225
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,166
Frozen now?

226
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:36,833
Go, Manoj.

227
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,708
-Get the rifle.
-Don't be scared. Go!

228
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,333
Go!

229
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,166
-Go!
-Get the rifle, Manoj!

230
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,541
Dushyant sir!

231
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,750
Dushyant sir!

232
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:06,208
-Where do you think you're going?
-I must see Dushyant sir.

233
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,708
-Look at the time.
-Please. It's urgent!

234
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:12,333
-It's very urgent!
-Shut up!

235
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,541
Stop pushing me.
I just want to talk to him.

236
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,791
Dushyant sir!

237
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,791
Be quiet, he's asleep.

238
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,000
Dushyant sir!

239
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,333
Sir.

240
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,750
Jackie, sit.
Who's this boy?

241
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:34,500
Sir...

242
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,333
Sir, they've arrested my brother
and taken our rickshaw.

243
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,625
Come tomorrow. I'll look into it.

244
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,791
-Sir, but...
-I said, tomorrow!

245
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's go, Jackie.

246
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,166
Get out.

247
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,291
Go!

248
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,916
For us, it's tomorrow?

249
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,000
Why did you come on time that day
to stop us cheating?

250
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:56,750
If you'd come the next day,
I'd have passed. Found a job.

251
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,500
Earned for my family.

252
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,333
That day you cared about honesty!

253
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:04,041
Your men will shoot my brother tonight,

254
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,916
and now you say, "Come tomorrow"?

255
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,458
I spit on such honesty.

256
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:10,458
Stop!

257
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,125
Tell me everything.

258
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,416
Go sit over there.

259
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,083
Prop your leg up.

260
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,500
Jai Hind, sir.

261
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,250
What did he do?

262
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,333
Tell him.

263
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,333
Sir, I was riding in their rickshaw.
They were smuggling alcohol.

264
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,791
He's lying.

265
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,291
Carry on.

266
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,833
I said, "I'll call the police."

267
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,458
He ran his rickshaw over my leg.

268
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,083
-This leg?
-Yes, sir.

269
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,125
You can go.

270
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,791
Go, go home.

271
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,375
Sit down.

272
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,791
I thought you went to get the rifle.

273
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:37,208
That was smart, brother.
You saved my life.

274
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,541
I think that's Dushyant Singh's car.

275
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,625
-Namaste, sir.
-Hello, sir.

276
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,000
Get in.

277
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,000
Get in. I'll drop you home.

278
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,625
You're pretty tough for a little guy.

279
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,291
What's your name?

280
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,666
Sir... Manoj.

281
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,291
Manoj, talk to him about our rickshaw.

282
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,750
Sir, may I say something?

283
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,333
Sure.

284
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,875
Our dad is an honest man. Like you.

285
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,458
But his honesty gets him suspended
wherever he goes.

286
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,541
So I started believing honesty
was pretty worthless.

287
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,500
-Not entirely worthless.
-No, no, sir!

288
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,958
When I saw you, I realised...

289
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:19,583
if an honest man has power,
it makes all the difference.

290
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:25,250
You cheat, but your words are wise.

291
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:26,958
Good!

292
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,333
Sir, you can stop here.

293
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,500
Thank you, sir.

294
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,750
What nonsense were you talking?

295
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,958
Ask about our rickshaw. Go!

296
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,625
Sir, one last question.

297
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,416
Yes?

298
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,708
Sir, I want to be like you.

299
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,500
What should I do?

300
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,541
Stop cheating! That's all.

301
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,750
Let's go?

302
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,333
Become like him?
What do you mean?

303
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:27,583
I'll become a big cop.
Like him.

304
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,833
Great idea. Do it!

305
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,875
Don't worry about money.

306
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,708
I'll manage that.
You focus on your studies.

307
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:40,333
Next year, as expected,
Deputy Dushyant Singh was transferred.

308
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:48,125
The Mayor's school went back
to its age-old tradition of cheating!

309
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,250
Only one student didn't cheat.

310
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,250
Because Dushyant Singh's voice
echoed in his mind.

311
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,583
"Stop cheating! That's all."

312
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:02,916
For the next three years,
Manoj studied like a man possessed.

313
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:10,083
To make ends meet, his mother sold
the family's only valuable possessions,

314
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,833
one after the other.

315
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,625
Come, my little one...

316
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,416
On the day Manoj passed his B.A. exam,
his grandma said...

317
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,375
Shut the door.

318
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,625
Bolt it.

319
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,875
Get the trunk out.

320
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,416
So much money?

321
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,750
It was tough hiding it
from your mother.

322
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,750
Go.

323
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,375
Don't worry about expenses.

324
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Come back a big police officer.

325
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,583
Your grandpa would be proud
seeing you in a police uniform.

326
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,208
Grandma!

327
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,875
-Take care, son.
-You, too.

328
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,416
-Phone every month.
-I will.

329
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,375
You must study hard.

330
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,583
Listen...

331
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,833
A surprise for you.

332
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,375
It was hard to find.

333
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:15,833
-Is this the right book?
-Oh, yes!

334
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,833
Start studying on the bus.

335
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,583
Hurry.

336
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,375
-Eat your food on the way.
-I will.

337
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,083
-Call us as soon as you get there.
-I will. Take care.

338
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,000
Tell grandma I'll call her soon.

339
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,750
Sorry.

340
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,500
You can sit here.

341
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,750
Sweetie, come here, let him sit.

342
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,375
Where are you going?

343
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,583
To Gwalior. To his father.

344
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,500
Me, too! To the city
to become a big police officer.

345
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,375
Gwalior! We've reached.

346
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:18,500
Everyone, out. Last stop.

347
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:25,500
Gwalior. Get off.

348
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Wake up! We've reached Gwalior.

349
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,291
Mister!

350
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:53,083
My red bag was here.
Where is it?

351
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,000
-Was that your bag?
-Yes.

352
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,541
The lady sitting next to you...
she took it.

353
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,333
-What?
-Yes.

354
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,000
That was my bag.
How could she take it?

355
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,333
She's gone.

356
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:04,583
Hey!

357
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,833
Mister!

358
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,000
She got off an hour ago in Barua.

359
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,250
She got off an hour ago in Barua.

360
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,500
[Pratiksha Coaching Centre, Gwalior]

361
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,666
Morena-Jaura-Bilgaon!

362
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:28,000
It was tough hiding it
from your mother.

363
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,333
She got off an hour ago in Barua.

364
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,000
Go!

365
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,583
Come back a big police officer.

366
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:49,250
Your grandpa would be proud
seeing you in a police uniform. Go!

367
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,000
What time does
the coaching class start?

368
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,000
Don't you read the newspapers?

369
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,375
Why? What happened?

370
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,750
The state government stopped recruiting.

371
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:03,375
-No more PCS exams.
-Why?

372
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,875
The government is broke.

373
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,291
No money to pay salaries.

374
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:09,333
How can the government do that?

375
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,000
It's the government.
It can do anything.

376
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,083
Off you go.

377
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,083
Go!

378
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:13,333
The boy from that small village
was lost in the big city of Gwalior.

379
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,250
Famished, for days he sat outside
a restaurant.

380
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,833
A war was raging inside him.

381
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,500
A war between his pride and his hunger.

382
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,000
The day his hunger
got the better of him,

383
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,250
he walked in.

384
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,333
Uncle ji?

385
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,750
Uncle.

386
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:36,833
Yes?

387
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:41,291
I'm starving. Could I have some food?

388
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:43,375
I'd happily do some work for you.

389
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,500
I have no money.

390
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,708
Boy, give him a plate.

391
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:02,458
That was the day I saw Manoj
for the first time.

392
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,250
He polished off the plate
in under two minutes.

393
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,500
Never seen such a feat before!

394
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,000
Sir, it was delicious.

395
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:20,500
-What can I do for you?
-Let it be.

396
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:22,791
No, no. Just tell me, I'll do anything!

397
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,750
You're a student, right?
Pay me later.

398
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,250
I'm not a student.
They cancelled the PCS.

399
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:31,333
Everything I brought from the village
got stolen. I have nothing.

400
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,708
Tell me what work I can do,
or I won't budge.

401
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,000
Stop pestering me. Go!

402
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,500
If you'd said so earlier,
I wouldn't have eaten.

403
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:39,583
Hey!

404
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,833
I'll pay for us both.

405
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:43,083
Why? Who the hell are you?

406
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,750
It's not just your exams
that were cancelled. All of ours were too.

407
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,458
What's done is done.

408
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,958
Oh... so what do we do now?

409
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,750
I don't know...
Go back home.

410
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,833
I can't.

411
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:06,208
Why not?

412
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:09,750
Grandma gave me her life savings,

413
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,958
so I'd become a DSP.

414
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,750
What will I tell her?

415
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:17,083
That her money got stolen
and I ran back home?

416
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,208
It's like a Greek tragedy.

417
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,583
Namaste, Papa. I'm on the train.

418
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,375
I'll call as soon as I get to Delhi.

419
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,708
Yes, I'll phone. Don't worry, Papa.

420
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,375
Okay, see you.

421
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,375
-Are you going home?
-No, to Delhi.

422
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,875
Why Delhi?

423
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,833
To prepare for the UPSC exam.

424
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,000
What's UPSC?

425
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,583
You don't know the civil service exam?

426
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,000
The IAS, IPS exam.

427
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,333
IPS?

428
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,291
The Indian Police Service exam?

429
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You came to become a DSP, right?

430
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,333
An IPS officer is far senior to a DSP.

431
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,166
Senior to a DSP?

432
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:14,250
A DSP has to slog for some
20 years to become an IPS officer.

433
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,208
I will become an IPS officer.

434
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,000
-You're kidding me, right?
-No. What time is the train to Delhi?

435
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,000
And the fare?
You'll pay it by washing the train?

436
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:33,000
Please take me with you,
I'll pay you back.

437
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,333
Where will you sleep in Delhi?
On the streets?

438
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,708
I'll manage. Just take me with you.

439
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,041
Can't clear the food bill,
wants to clear the IPS exam.

440
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,375
Yes, I will become an IPS officer.

441
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,750
-This guy was really stubborn!
-Please take me along.

442
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,375
My gut warned me,
"Pritam Pandey, walk away!"

443
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,500
But before I could,
my tongue slipped...

444
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,625
Let's go. But on one condition.

445
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,000
I pay for your meal.

446
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,333
Give me the change.

447
00:32:58,541 --> 00:33:00,125
Hurry, hurry!

448
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:07,083
I could see how happy he was,
that he'd be senior to a DSP.

449
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:10,000
But once we entered
Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar...

450
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:13,500
our hero's resolve was totally rattled.

451
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:56,583
Manoj!

452
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,083
Manoj?

453
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,000
-Morning!
-Morning, Tutul!

454
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:20,000
Where's the champagne?

455
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:21,583
Now?

456
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,083
Champagne's drunk at night, no?

457
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,875
I brought bread and eggs for now.

458
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,750
Come on.

459
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,750
Manoj!

460
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,833
Manoj...

461
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,375
Are you okay?

462
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,000
There are millions of students.

463
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,333
How will I manage?

464
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,000
I can tell you how!

465
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,583
There are three exams.
First the Prelims, then the Mains.

466
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:54,000
After that you have an interview.
Our brother Gauri knows the ropes.

467
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,333
He's been around for eight years.

468
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,625
Any problems... he solves them.

469
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,583
I've known him since I was 15.

470
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,708
His final result is due next week.

471
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,875
I bought a special red shirt
for the occasion.

472
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:11,000
He'll soon become an IPS officer.

473
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,500
I'll miss him terribly.

474
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,500
He always has a crowd around him!

475
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,708
But never turns anyone away.
Make way.

476
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,333
-English is a qualifying paper.
-He helps everyone.

477
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,750
Gauri sir, new students
need some guidance.

478
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,958
So bring them inside.

479
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,500
-Come in.
-Clear? It's the qualifying paper.

480
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,833
That day I met Gauri sir
for the first time.

481
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,750
Amazing fellow!

482
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,833
He spoke to us in spite of
so many students being there.

483
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:47,000
He explained how
the UPSC exam worked.

484
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,625
Played Snakes and Ladders?

485
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,250
Yes.

486
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,583
That's all the UPSC exam is.

487
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,458
Pay attention.
You are here.

488
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:59,041
The starting point is the Prelims.

489
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:02,000
200,000 Hindi-medium students
take them.

490
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,916
Only 1000-1500 make it
to the next ladder, the Mains exam.

491
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,291
That's it?

492
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,333
Shat your pants?

493
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:16,708
Out of 1500, only 150-200
make it to the Interview.

494
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,916
So close to the finish line.

495
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:24,083
But here sits the poisonous cobra
that bites 8 out of 10 applicants.

496
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:28,750
Out of 200,000 Hindi-medium applicants,

497
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:32,750
only 25-30 become IAS or IPS officers
each year.

498
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:35,500
Only 25-30 out of 200,000?

499
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:40,083
The rest, 199,970, go back to zero.

500
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,500
Restart!

501
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,041
Restart?

502
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,125
Like the game of Snakes and Ladders.

503
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,958
So, restart.

504
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,041
I've failed five times in five years.

505
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,125
I hit restart five times.

506
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,208
That's when I realized what was missing.

507
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,375
Motivation!

508
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,500
So I got this police uniform,

509
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:08,000
determined to return to my village in it

510
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,375
and salute my parents.

511
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:18,458
Fired by that motivation, I gave
my best interview in my sixth attempt.

512
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,166
But I heard we only get four attempts?

513
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,083
You have a problem if I get six?

514
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,083
You heard right.

515
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,375
The open category gets four attempts.

516
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,625
Since I'm from a backward caste,
I get six.

517
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,000
Anything else?

518
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,750
Brother Gauri.

519
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:45,250
Can I talk to you... in private?

520
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,500
-Are you English medium?
-No.

521
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Hindi-medium students speak openly!
Tell me.

522
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,541
Tell him.

523
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,500
Go on!

524
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,333
Brother...

525
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,750
I'm a little short on funds.

526
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,333
Can you help me get a job somewhere?

527
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:15,083
When I came here, I cleaned toilets
for three years.

528
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:18,250
-Can you?
-I'll do anything.

529
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:22,250
-All right, consider it done.
-Thank you, Gauri sir.

530
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,833
The toilet needs daily cleaning.

531
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
UPSC students study here.

532
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,750
They shouldn't waste time finding books.

533
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,250
I'll pay 280 rupees a month.

534
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,250
And a room to sleep in.

535
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,833
But if you're five minutes late,
I'll cut the entire day's wages.

536
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,250
I'll be five minutes early, sir!

537
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:45,833
All right.

538
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Hariram, show him the room.

539
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,583
Thank you, sir.

540
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,541
Thank you so much!

541
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,916
Pass me the glass!

542
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,041
To your first job!

543
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,166
-No, no. Not for me.
-Pandey-ji?

544
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,208
May I have a little?

545
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,791
-Are you sure?
-Not for me.

546
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,541
Here, Tutul.

547
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,583
This is the first time I've bought
such an expensive bottle for anyone.

548
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:15,833
It's good.

549
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:20,000
Blowing up dirty money
is very satisfying.

550
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,958
What do you mean?

551
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:25,666
My father is a contractor
for the Public Works Department.

552
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,083
He takes a lot of bribes.

553
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,083
He wants me to do the same.

554
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,875
Ah, so that's why you aim
to become an honest officer!

555
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:35,250
Honest officer, my ass!

556
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:40,583
First, he sent me to Gwalior
for the PCS exam

557
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,708
to become a Deputy Collector.

558
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,833
Double the dirty income!

559
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:47,750
Then that got cancelled,
so he says go to Delhi for UPSC.

560
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,833
Become an even higher-ranked officer.

561
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:51,958
Triple the dirty income!

562
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,958
I don't want to do that.

563
00:39:55,416 --> 00:39:57,833
Then what do you want to do?

564
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:05,083
No one's ever asked me that.

565
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,750
Man, I'd like to be on TV.

566
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,958
-Really?
-Yes!

567
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:16,583
But I don't have the balls
to tell my father.

568
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,875
Tell your mother then.

569
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,708
I would have...

570
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,333
if she was alive.

571
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:43,625
Then came the day of the final results.

572
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:48,708
Tutul wore his new red shirt,
with Gauri's uniform in his hands.

573
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:53,750
But Gauri couldn't find his name
on the list.

574
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,166
He kept looking...

575
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,916
looking...

576
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,458
Eventually, it dawned on us...

577
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:09,958
Gauri had failed his last attempt too.

578
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:16,750
That day, I realised
I was following a loser.

579
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,833
For that year's topper was
an English-medium student Deep Mohan.

580
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,291
I switched teams.

581
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:27,291
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

582
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:29,958
Manoj and I went different ways.

583
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,833
What will brother Gauri do now?

584
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:55,458
Night was spent scratching the head

585
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,875
Blind feet find no path ahead

586
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,500
Tutul, switch on the light.

587
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,916
[Restart Tea Stall]

588
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:05,500
Bring on some light,
Dispel the night!

589
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,416
When blues you spurn,
Tables will turn

590
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:11,083
Then with all your heart

591
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,583
Let's restart.

592
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:16,333
My attempts are over, not yours.

593
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,583
So what if I didn't make it?
You will.

594
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:24,083
If any one of you becomes an officer,
it'll be my victory too. Got it?

595
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,000
What say, Manoj?

596
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,750
-Guidance will be free. But, Tutul...
-Yes, sir?

597
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:31,541
Charge them for the tea.

598
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:32,583
Got it, Gauri sir.

599
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:33,708
Let's go.

600
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,250
Restart from zero!

601
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,583
This is no school exam.

602
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,250
It's the UPSC Prelims.

603
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,333
They can ask any question
from any subject. Got it?

604
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:45,958
But there's no reason to fear.
Learning comes from everywhere.

605
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:47,875
Read the newspaper,
listen to the radio.

606
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,083
Need more information?
I'm here!

607
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,875
Zeros you must not shun

608
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:57,125
They turn one to million

609
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,583
Your Prelims are tomorrow.

610
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:02,500
It's your first time.
Don't get nervous.

611
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:05,916
Zeros you must not shun

612
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,625
They turn one to million

613
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,833
Make wheels of the zero

614
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,833
And march on like a hero

615
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:16,333
Got it, everyone?

616
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,208
All the very best!

617
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,750
Rock the exam!

618
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:22,541
Go, get 'em!

619
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:24,458
Night was spent scratching the head,

620
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:25,458
Manoj Kumar Sharma.

621
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:28,000
Blind feet find no path ahead

622
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:31,875
Bring on some light,
Dispel the night!

623
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:32,791
Fail. You've failed.

624
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,708
-What?
-Fail.

625
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,875
You've failed. Next!

626
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:38,958
-You've failed.
-Check mine.

627
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,000
Pass!

628
00:43:57,458 --> 00:44:00,500
Restart!

629
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:08,625
Manoj hit restart in his life.

630
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,833
He worked in the library
for another year.

631
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:16,708
He studied hard, and whenever he could,
he'd help Gauri.

632
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:21,083
One day, the Hindi-medium Manoj
landed up in the English-medium world.

633
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:25,125
And met my guru, IAS officer Deep Mohan.

634
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:27,833
The interview is about who you are.

635
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,958
Right? So, be yourself.

636
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:33,000
For example,

637
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,958
the final question they asked me was...

638
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,083
"What do you think
about the walls of this room?"

639
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:43,500
And I said,
"Sir, I don't think about them."

640
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,750
What timing, Chhotu. Come!

641
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,875
-Coffee?
-Sir, he's not a tea-boy.

642
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:54,208
He's a UPSC student
and my friend Manoj.

643
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,791
I'm so sorry, Manoj.

644
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,083
It's okay.

645
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,333
Naval, take the tray. Serve the rest.

646
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:01,333
Sure.

647
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:02,708
Give it to him.

648
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,291
-I'm so sorry I called you that.
-Never mind.

649
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,375
I owe you one.

650
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:14,958
If you ever need help, come to me.

651
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,750
Deep Mohan was pitying Manoj.

652
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:20,833
Nice coffee.

653
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,833
But Manoj didn't realize this.

654
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,291
He kept studying all year long...

655
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,875
fighting a lost battle.

656
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:31,958
And me?

657
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:37,250
-You smell better than coffee...
-Excellent!

658
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:40,000
Oh, aromatic coffee!

659
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:41,166
Such deep lyrics!

660
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:42,958
Tutul!

661
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:45,083
-Three coffees, buddy.
-Right away.

662
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:47,666
Welcome, Naval.

663
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,250
Listen, bro...

664
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,375
Thank you...

665
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,458
for my first all-night party.

666
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,750
Hey Manoj! How the hell are you?

667
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:55,833
First class!

668
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,458
Gauri sir! I'm off.

669
00:45:57,583 --> 00:45:59,791
Eat something first.
You'll faint. Here, catch!

670
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:00,875
Where are you off to?

671
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,125
To the library! I'm late.

672
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,375
-Bye!
-Bye!

673
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:06,458
Where did you find him?

674
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:09,083
At Gwalior station.

675
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,833
He hadn't even heard of IPS.

676
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:14,125
But said, "I'll be an IPS officer."

677
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,458
I brought him to Delhi.

678
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:18,958
Poor guy failed miserably
in his first attempt.

679
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:22,750
I feel bad for him.

680
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:25,708
People like him come in herds
from every corner of India

681
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,458
wanting to become IPS officers.

682
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:30,708
Then instead of studying, they spend
all their time in menial jobs.

683
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,041
Hello, Gauri sir.

684
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,333
I mean, no disrespect...

685
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,458
but you're just wasting
the country's resources, man!

686
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:40,000
You can't become IPS officers.

687
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,708
Just accept it and move on!

688
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,833
You're right.

689
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,000
You're absolutely right.

690
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:52,708
We come in herds,
stuffed in buses and trains.

691
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,833
We come with nothing.

692
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,500
Our fathers have nothing.

693
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,500
They're vegetable vendors,
truck drivers, street sweepers.

694
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:17,333
They all slog under the scorching sun,
just like my father.

695
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:23,083
They can't afford to send their children
to expensive schools.

696
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,583
They don't have the money
for coaching classes.

697
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:31,875
But you should know,
we don't come empty-handed.

698
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:36,208
We bring our will, determined
to become officers one day.

699
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:40,833
Even if we have to sweep libraries
or clean toilets.

700
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:45,333
We never give up.

701
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,541
Our will is rock solid.

702
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And this will isn't bred
in some fancy school.

703
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,000
It is born from the hopes and dreams
of millions of Indians.

704
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:01,333
Our will is our wealth.

705
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,041
Winning and losing
is all part of life, Naval.

706
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:10,083
But from us millions,
when even one makes it,

707
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:13,583
the whole herd wins.

708
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:21,083
Manoj...

709
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,083
Get up, son.

710
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:30,833
Isn't it your second attempt today?

711
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:33,083
Yes. What time is it?

712
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:34,708
You still have time.

713
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:35,958
Go, shower first.

714
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,208
No, I need to revise.

715
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,458
You remind me of my UPSC days.

716
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:44,583
I sat for the exam four times,
from this very library.

717
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:46,458
And?

718
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,750
And 30 years later, you're here!

719
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:52,083
Go, shower. Freshen up.

720
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,625
Check Manoj Kumar Sharma.

721
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:12,583
Most students have failed, Papa-ji.
I'll pass next time.

722
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:13,500
What happened?

723
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,458
-Bro!
-What did your dad say?

724
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:19,083
Can I borrow your phone?
I need to give Ma the news.

725
00:49:19,208 --> 00:49:20,458
-What news?
-I passed!

726
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,958
-Are you serious?
-Oh, my God! Congrats!

727
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,041
That's amazing.

728
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:27,750
My Manoj has made it!

729
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:29,958
-You've restarted?
-Yes, brother!

730
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:33,500
Now find the best coaching
and prepare for the Mains.

731
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,958
Come here. Congratulations!

732
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:39,250
You've been in the same clothes
since Gwalior.

733
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:40,833
I'll buy you some new ones.

734
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:43,000
He cleared the Prelims.
That's no joke.

735
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,416
-Bravo!
-Brother, the phone?

736
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
Of course, here. Call her!

737
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,833
I first met him in Gwalior.
He hadn't even heard of IPS.

738
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,083
But he was hell-bent
on becoming an IPS officer.

739
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,333
I brought him here.

740
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:57,958
Hello! This is Manoj.
Get Ma! Hurry!

741
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:02,125
Search all of Mukherjee Nagar,
there's no better coaching than us.

742
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,208
Yes, I've heard about you.

743
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,583
Professor Arora will be awarded
the Padma Shri next month.

744
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,500
Look at this.

745
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:13,291
We capture the moment our students
become IAS and IPS officers.

746
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,208
No one else here does this.

747
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,125
And we're also the only ones
who coach in both English and Hindi.

748
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:22,541
That's why we're called "A2Z".

749
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:25,125
I know! That's why I've come to you.

750
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:29,208
Ma'am, is a higher discount possible?

751
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:31,458
I've already offered you 10%.

752
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:34,333
Ma'am, please.
Money is a slight problem right now

753
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:39,958
I can work. Cleaning, chores...
Anything you need doing.

754
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:43,000
I really need the coaching.
Please, ma'am.

755
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:47,083
Okay, fine. Give me your deposit.
1200 rupees.

756
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:50,458
1200...

757
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:56,916
Ma'am, I only have 680 right now.

758
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,166
I'll pay the rest in installments.

759
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:03,333
-You are unbelievable!
-Please, ma'am. I really need this.

760
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:05,875
Fine, we'll work it out.

761
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:07,958
Go help that guy over there
with the photos.

762
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:12,625
Hello, ma'am! Hello, sir!

763
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,375
I'm Zai Arora. The Z in A2Z.

764
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,208
Professor Arora's daughter.

765
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:19,708
He's going to be awarded
the Padma Shri next month.

766
00:51:19,708 --> 00:51:20,708
-Oh, nice!
-Yes.

767
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:22,125
You see this?

768
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:25,833
We capture the moment when our students
become IAS and IPS officers.

769
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,416
We offer coaching in both English
and Hindi.

770
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:31,791
That's why we're called A2Z.

771
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:35,000
Ma'am! You've made a mistake.
Deep Mohan didn't study here.

772
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,750
Please fill up the form.
I'll just be back.

773
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,500
What the hell?

774
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:47,166
Ma'am, you're mistaken.

775
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,625
Deep Mohan is self-taught.
I know him.

776
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:54,250
Have you ever met a movie star?

777
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:55,166
What?

778
00:51:55,458 --> 00:51:57,583
The biggest celebs? Have you met them?

779
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,500
No.

780
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:02,750
You think they chew the same tobacco
they sell you?

781
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,875
It's called advertising.

782
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,416
We paid Deep Mohan 150,000 rupees.

783
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,750
If you top, we'll pay you too.

784
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,333
Now be quiet and help him.
Bloody idiot!

785
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,083
-What was he saying?
-Nothing.

786
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:21,458
Didn't Deep Mohan study here?

787
00:52:21,583 --> 00:52:23,875
Of course, he did.
See? That's him.

788
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:25,916
See... how happy he looks.

789
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,208
What were you saying?

790
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:33,041
I said Deep did not study here.
I know him.

791
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:34,208
She's lying.

792
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:35,833
She calls it "advertising".

793
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:37,500
Are you lying?

794
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:38,958
Of course not!

795
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:41,625
Sir, Deep's father sat
where you're sitting.

796
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,583
Show me his admission form.

797
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:45,291
-Pardon?
-Very good idea, Papa.

798
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:46,875
Show his admission form.

799
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:49,333
I can't. It's a private document.

800
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,750
If you don't want admission,
please just go.

801
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:53,250
Let's go, Papa.

802
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:54,750
I don't want to study here either.

803
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:56,875
Here's my form. Return my deposit.

804
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,375
The deposit is non-refundable.

805
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,333
How can that be?

806
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,583
-When did you give it?
-Moments before you got here.

807
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,375
Here's your 680 rupees.

808
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:07,083
Don't show your face again.

809
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:09,500
We don't want to see
your face either, madam.

810
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:10,750
Yes, sir.

811
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:12,291
Have a good day, sir.

812
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:15,208
Wait... please don't worry.

813
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,208
We'll find a good coaching academy.

814
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:19,291
You're also looking for PCS coaching?

815
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,125
No. For the UPSC Mains.

816
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,875
Where did you coach for Prelims?

817
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,333
I didn't. I'm self-taught.

818
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,875
You passed without coaching?

819
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:31,083
Wow! What's your name?

820
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,208
Manoj Kumar Sharma. And yours?

821
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:35,000
-Sh--
-Let's go, dear. Thank you.

822
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,333
Sir!

823
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:41,333
If you need any help,

824
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:44,333
I'm at the Vidya Library all day,
studying.

825
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,000
Sure. Thank you!

826
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:59,375
You passed without coaching?
Wow! What's your name?

827
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,625
Hello! Get out, please.

828
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:03,375
Yes. Thank you.

829
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,125
Manoj was ecstatic.

830
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:10,166
It was the first time
a city girl had spoken to him.

831
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,500
Manoj kept thinking of that girl.

832
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:18,000
Whose name he didn't even know.

833
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,916
You're an engineer?

834
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:35,625
You?

835
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,500
Aeronautical?

836
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:44,083
No wonder you managed without coaching.

837
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:46,625
I thought you'd gone home.

838
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,375
No. We looked around and found
a good coaching academy.

839
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:53,333
Tell me which one. I'll enroll too.

840
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,000
Hi! I'm Shraddha.

841
00:54:58,625 --> 00:54:59,958
Manoj.

842
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,000
So, this is where you study?

843
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:07,958
-Yes.
-Nice.

844
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:11,125
Please have a seat.

845
00:55:24,875 --> 00:55:27,791
-Your father?
-He went back to Mussoorie.

846
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,458
I see.

847
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,625
Where do you live in Mussoorie?

848
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,750
-You know Company Garden?
-Yes.

849
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:42,458
There's a small road
that goes up the hill from there.

850
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,125
My house is 50 steps away.

851
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:52,708
Did you study in Mussoorie too?

852
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:53,958
Yes.

853
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:56,000
My father wanted me to be a doctor.

854
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:59,708
But one day, I decided to join
the civil services.

855
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:00,750
Wow!

856
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,833
So Papa said, "Go to Delhi.

857
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,166
"Learn from the best."

858
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:06,583
He came here specially to settle me in.

859
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,250
Where did you study engineering?

860
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,250
Er...

861
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,125
-Gwalior--
-Hey, boy!

862
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:16,708
Did you sell the scrap?

863
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,333
I'll do it right away.

864
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:22,083
I don't pay you to gossip.

865
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:23,625
Do it right now!

866
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,083
Yes, sir.

867
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:31,333
Do you work here?

868
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:36,125
Yes, work in the day
and study at night.

869
00:56:37,083 --> 00:56:41,458
I read that President Abdul Kalam
used to study under a street lamp.

870
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,708
I have a whole library.

871
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:46,500
Absolutely.

872
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,458
Here, last week's notes for you.

873
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,708
Will you be at the library tomorrow?

874
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:54,333
I have the day off for Diwali.

875
00:56:54,458 --> 00:56:58,125
-Would you like to go to Delhi Haat?
-Sure.

876
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:03,833
Please sit down.

877
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:11,375
Around 2000 of my students
have become civil servants.

878
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:14,458
IAS, IPS and PCS officers.

879
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:16,333
All high-ranking officers.

880
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,458
Like you, they would stand up
as a sign of respect.

881
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:25,583
To be honest,
out of those 2000 students,

882
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:29,833
barely 20, about 1%,
make me stand up for them.

883
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:32,458
Know why?

884
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:37,333
Because... no matter what

885
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,458
I know their integrity isn't for sale.

886
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:46,166
I trust our Country, our Constitution
is safe in their hands.

887
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:49,000
Becoming an IAS officer
is not as important

888
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,041
as it is to understand

889
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:55,583
that you should not be respected
for your rank,

890
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:59,125
but the rank should be respected
because of you.

891
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,958
A day will surely come
when you visit me,

892
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:04,458
that day, I will stand up, not you.

893
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:14,875
Before we begin... there's someone
called Manoj Kumar Sharma.

894
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,833
Who is Manoj Kumar Sharma?

895
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,750
Please stand up.

896
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:22,208
You? Please come here.

897
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,875
Come.

898
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:27,833
Don't worry.

899
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,750
Why did I call you here?

900
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:33,458
You know what you've done?

901
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,833
Did you write this?

902
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:36,708
Yes, sir.

903
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:40,125
Relax! You've done well.

904
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,625
I read all these yesterday.

905
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,375
And there was one outstanding essay.

906
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,208
Manoj's essay.

907
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:51,708
The topic was "Terrorism in India".

908
00:58:51,916 --> 00:58:53,208
He covered everything.

909
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:56,666
The Naxal insurgency,
Jammu-Kashmir, the Northeast...

910
00:58:57,125 --> 00:59:03,333
Usually, I give one chocolate,
but he deserves two.

911
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:04,958
Let's give him a big hand.

912
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:08,625
Take your seat.

913
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:18,875
Now, let me explain
the concept of terrorism.

914
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:22,708
And how it is different
from other forms...

915
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:26,625
For you.

916
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:38,458
Old wounds hurt no more

917
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:43,333
Old wounds hurt no more

918
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:46,708
This heart is no longer sore

919
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:51,458
She knocked for coffee at my door

920
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:54,833
Now Pandey's solus days
are sore no more!

921
00:59:54,916 --> 01:00:00,000
-Wow! You write very well, Pandey-ji.
-Well, here's my inspiration!

922
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,750
What the hell is 'solus'?

923
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:03,083
-Lonely!
-Lonely!

924
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,833
Time for round two.

925
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:08,833
Truth or dare?

926
01:00:08,916 --> 01:00:09,666
Dare!

927
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:13,083
Yes! Sing that song.

928
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:16,958
Manoj! No... something else, please.

929
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,458
You have to sing.

930
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:21,958
I recited my poem.
Surely, you can sing your song.

931
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:24,458
-Go on.
-Okay.

932
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:36,375
What kites say
to the endless blue

933
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:46,041
How long should I wait
to hear it from you?

934
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:52,583
What the wind murmurs
to the cloud

935
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,083
Will I ever hear you
say the same aloud?

936
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,916
You sing really well.

937
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,250
Thank you.

938
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,375
Round three.

939
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:38,916
What the heart says
through its flutter

940
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:51,541
Why is it something
you cannot utter?

941
01:01:56,625 --> 01:02:01,375
If lips speak so bravely
to the flute

942
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:07,000
Why are you content
to stay mute?

943
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,958
What flowers hear--

944
01:02:10,083 --> 01:02:11,958
Will you have a cup of tea?

945
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:14,291
-Sure.
-I'll get it.

946
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:19,625
What flowers hear
from butterflies

947
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:25,375
Why must I only read
in your eyes?

948
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:32,000
Why are you content
to stay mute?

949
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,041
Won't you say something?

950
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:36,250
Hi!

951
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:38,375
Where were you?

952
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:40,375
Just a second.

953
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:46,916
Happy Diwali!

954
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:51,291
Shraddha, how can I accept it?

955
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:53,708
Like this.

956
01:02:56,166 --> 01:02:57,541
Thank you.

957
01:02:57,666 --> 01:03:00,666
Did you know Abdul Kalam
would study under a street lamp?

958
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:06,083
I really wanted to read this book.

959
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:08,291
Thank you.

960
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:13,541
Your tea. It'll get cold.

961
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,791
Cheers.

962
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:22,708
If lips speak so bravely
to the flute...

963
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:29,458
Last Diwali, I decided
not to be a doctor.

964
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:32,916
I chose to join
the civil services instead.

965
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:34,458
Last Diwali?

966
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:38,291
Yes. I was interning at a hospital.

967
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,166
A patient arrived.

968
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:41,833
An 18-year-old girl...

969
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:44,458
in a nylon saree...
with third-degree burns.

970
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:46,833
A domestic violence case.

971
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,416
And as usual,

972
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:54,083
on the police report, they wrote
"Cause of death - accidental."

973
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:59,583
I thought if I had power,
I'd never let them get away with it.

974
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:06,291
Then I thought...
why can't I have power?

975
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:07,791
I can absolutely have it.

976
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:10,208
I can also become a Deputy Collector.

977
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:16,583
I told Papa and he said, "Go to Delhi!

978
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,333
"Learn from the best!"

979
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:31,958
Do you recognize this rocket?
Fireworks from your childhood?

980
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:35,708
Set it on fire and combustion occurs.

981
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:38,041
The gases generated move downwards

982
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:41,250
which propels the rocket upwards.

983
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:46,500
Whether a firework rocket
or a space rocket...

984
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:50,708
the technology in both rockets
is the same.

985
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:52,791
The principle is the same.

986
01:04:53,416 --> 01:04:56,333
And who can tell me that principle?

987
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:00,541
-Anyone?
-Why don't you answer?

988
01:05:00,791 --> 01:05:02,666
I don't know the answer.

989
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:04,083
Say whatever you know.

990
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:07,166
Shraddha, are you explaining
rocket science to Manoj?

991
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:14,083
No, sir. He knows the answer.
He's just shy.

992
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,333
He's an engineer.

993
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:16,875
An aeronautical engineer.

994
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:19,458
He has also read Abdul Kalam's book.

995
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,916
Manoj? Are you an engineer?

996
01:05:22,916 --> 01:05:26,916
I thought you had a BA degree
in History and Hindi?

997
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:28,916
Am I mistaken?

998
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,916
No, sir. I am a BA student.

999
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:36,208
So what's the confusion?

1000
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:42,375
Sir... it was a misunderstanding.

1001
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:45,125
Engineer? Him? From what angle?

1002
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,416
It's easy to mock others, right?

1003
01:05:50,416 --> 01:05:54,916
Misunderstandings happen.
It's okay. Let's move on.

1004
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,291
Please take a seat.

1005
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:01,416
I was holding an engineering book
and she...

1006
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:08,291
Shraddha, I was going to tell you.

1007
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,000
But I didn't get a chance.

1008
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:18,166
No... I had the chance,
but I didn't have the guts.

1009
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,500
Take your drama outside!
We're studying here.

1010
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:13,791
Manoj?

1011
01:07:13,916 --> 01:07:15,833
Why are you sitting in the dark?

1012
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,541
Saheb is calling.

1013
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:20,958
You all right?

1014
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:21,958
Yes.

1015
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:23,500
-The boss is waiting for you.
-Right now?

1016
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:24,416
Yes.

1017
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,041
What is this?

1018
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,250
Money.

1019
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:29,541
From where?

1020
01:07:30,625 --> 01:07:31,708
Selling scrap paper.

1021
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:33,750
Really? Only 4,800?

1022
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,000
Last year's scrap sold for 6,200.

1023
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:38,000
The scrap weighed 400 kgs.

1024
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:40,125
12 rupees a kilo makes 4,800.

1025
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:43,875
So you pocketed 1,400?

1026
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:48,958
I gave you the account, as is.

1027
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,875
See Hariram? How easily he lies.

1028
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:55,375
If this is how he behaves now,

1029
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,750
once he's an IPS,
he'll loot the whole country!

1030
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:00,750
Son of a thief!

1031
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:03,833
How dare you call my father a thief!

1032
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,250
We are not thieves!

1033
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,833
Manoj quit the library.

1034
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:32,333
He stopped attending class too.

1035
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:34,625
Stubborn fellow!

1036
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,458
And where did I finally find him?

1037
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,833
Malka Ganj, Lane no. 6.

1038
01:08:42,125 --> 01:08:44,208
Plot number 72.

1039
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:50,708
Up an iron staircase
and behind a broken blue door.

1040
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,416
How are you, brother?

1041
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,916
Is this where you live?

1042
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:09,500
Why did you quit the library?

1043
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:12,208
You're a mess.

1044
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,500
I'm so happy to meet you.

1045
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:17,166
Forget me. Go, meet Shraddha.

1046
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:19,208
She's going to Mussoorie
for her Prelims.

1047
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:21,083
Apologise to her.

1048
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:24,291
I'll apologise once I've cleared
my Mains.

1049
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:26,625
And how the hell will you do that?

1050
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:28,833
How will you study in this darkness?

1051
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,958
Like this.

1052
01:09:45,708 --> 01:09:48,208
Don't be stubborn.

1053
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:51,541
Move in with me. Study.
Or you'll go back to zero.

1054
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,416
How will you face Shraddha then?

1055
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,666
I'm good here...

1056
01:09:56,958 --> 01:10:00,208
What about the hopes
your family has pinned on you?

1057
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:05,791
This is the time to study hard.
Not to do all this.

1058
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:09,583
I kept after him, but he wouldn't listen.

1059
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:13,375
I was convinced he'd go back at zero.

1060
01:10:14,125 --> 01:10:18,208
But seeing him write the English exam
so furiously...

1061
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:22,916
even the English-medium students
felt insecure.

1062
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:26,333
How did it go?

1063
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:27,708
Fantastic!

1064
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:30,791
I got through English.
The rest is a cakewalk.

1065
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:32,541
The interview call is certain.

1066
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:33,541
Congrats!

1067
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:37,208
Can you believe my luck?
I got an essay I already knew.

1068
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,458
-Which one?
-The one on terrorism!

1069
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:42,208
In class, I wrote a great essay in Hindi
on that subject.

1070
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,041
So I just translated it to English.

1071
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:45,791
Which question was on terrorism?

1072
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:48,500
Not a question, the essay.
Look at page two.

1073
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:51,083
I wrote in great detail.

1074
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,750
Reason, impact,
how to solve the problem.

1075
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,625
Difference in Punjab terrorism,
Kashmir terrorism, Insurgency, Separatism...

1076
01:10:57,708 --> 01:10:59,958
Okay, but where the hell is it?

1077
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,375
Second page. First question.

1078
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:08,750
Learn to read English, bro,
please forget the IPS.

1079
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:11,833
It's not "Terrorism in India".
It's "Tourism in India".

1080
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:14,375
T-O-U-R-I-S-M.

1081
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:19,208
Check this one too. It won't change.

1082
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,375
You've failed.

1083
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:24,583
That was your qualifying paper.

1084
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:28,500
There goes your second attempt.

1085
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,875
And he thought
the interview call was certain!

1086
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,666
After that day, Manoj was not seen anywhere.

1087
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,791
I kept looking for him.

1088
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,250
Then one day I got to know

1089
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:52,291
that he has left the city
and gone somewhere.

1090
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,541
45, 46, 47...

1091
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,083
48, 49, 50.

1092
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:17,125
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

1093
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:18,583
I'm here to meet Shraddha.

1094
01:13:18,708 --> 01:13:21,458
-Who are you?
-Manoj. Her friend from Delhi.

1095
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,583
There's a wedding in the family.
They've all gone there.

1096
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:26,875
I see.

1097
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:29,083
May I have the address?

1098
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:31,750
-The address?
-Or a phone number?

1099
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:35,625
Why don't you come in?

1100
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,083
Hello? Kishan here.

1101
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:53,333
Someone's here to meet
Miss Shraddha.

1102
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:03,583
Sure.

1103
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:16,708
Shraddha-ji, your friend from Delhi
is here.

1104
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,458
Yes. Here...

1105
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,958
Hello, Shraddha!

1106
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:26,375
Manoj?

1107
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,333
How did you get my address?

1108
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,833
You gave it to me. You've forgotten?

1109
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:34,333
Company Garden... 50 steps up the hill.

1110
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:36,083
Why have you come?

1111
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,875
I'll bring you some water.

1112
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:49,208
To apologise to you.

1113
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:52,083
Can we meet for five minutes, please?

1114
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,583
How did you do
in your Mains exam?

1115
01:14:57,958 --> 01:15:00,041
I messed up the qualifying paper.

1116
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,708
How come?

1117
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,708
I wrote on terrorism, instead of tourism.

1118
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:08,708
How could you make such a mistake?

1119
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:15,583
I thought you'd be so happy to know
that my English exam went well.

1120
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:19,416
In the excitement, I didn't double check
the essay topic.

1121
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,833
And instead of studying again,
you've landed up at my house?

1122
01:15:25,708 --> 01:15:27,208
Yes, I...

1123
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:33,333
I wanted to tell you something.

1124
01:15:33,583 --> 01:15:34,958
What is it?

1125
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:37,583
Speak up!

1126
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:42,458
Shraddha...

1127
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,625
I love you.

1128
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,333
What?

1129
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:51,125
Yes.

1130
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:54,708
Now you also say it.

1131
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,833
Say what?

1132
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:00,875
Just... "I love you."

1133
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:07,125
Then I'll turn the world
upside down for you, Shraddha.

1134
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,333
Please give the phone to Kishan.

1135
01:16:11,958 --> 01:16:12,958
Huh?

1136
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:17,500
He's gone inside.

1137
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:19,083
Call him back.

1138
01:16:22,333 --> 01:16:24,375
Shraddha, but...

1139
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:26,333
Water?

1140
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:31,708
Yes, Shraddha-ji?

1141
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,250
All right.

1142
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:43,333
She says you should go back to Delhi.

1143
01:18:14,375 --> 01:18:15,458
Manoj...

1144
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,125
My dear friend!

1145
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:24,958
You're looking good.

1146
01:18:26,583 --> 01:18:27,875
Where have you been?

1147
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:29,083
Delhi.

1148
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,458
Thank God you're here.

1149
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:38,333
What happened?

1150
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:44,666
Rajni!

1151
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:50,500
Brother!

1152
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,583
It's been so long...

1153
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:00,791
Is Papa okay?

1154
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:03,291
Yes. He wrote a few days ago.

1155
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,083
You've grown so tall!

1156
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:09,250
Should I have shrunk down?

1157
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,000
Where's Ma?

1158
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,333
-She'll be back by evening.
-Evening?

1159
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:17,083
She goes to graze the cows.
The ones that we sold.

1160
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,166
And Kamlesh?

1161
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,875
He lives far away in Jaura now.

1162
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:22,125
He's a daily-wage earner.

1163
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:25,750
Brother, are you a DSP now?

1164
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:30,458
Where's Grandma?

1165
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:39,125
Where's Grandma?

1166
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:45,333
Hey?

1167
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,458
Tell me!

1168
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,250
-Why wasn't I told?
-Grandma told us not to.

1169
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:32,625
Why didn't you tell me?

1170
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:35,250
-We haven't even told your father.
-Why not?

1171
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:37,416
Grandma forbade us.

1172
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:42,458
She said, "They are both doing
important work.

1173
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:45,000
"Don't bother them for nothing."

1174
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:50,250
She used to say,

1175
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:54,833
"My Manoj will only return
in a police uniform."

1176
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:04,708
Come, my child... sit.

1177
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,000
Rajni!

1178
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,208
Yes, Ma.

1179
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:20,875
Pass me the oil.

1180
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,750
Are you cooking dinner?
Good girl.

1181
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:32,250
Sit here, my son.

1182
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:44,500
We're all okay.

1183
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:49,208
Kamlesh is earning good wages.

1184
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:54,541
The cows that we had to sell...

1185
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:57,458
I'm caring for them again.

1186
01:21:58,458 --> 01:22:00,625
It makes me so happy.

1187
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:07,791
Rajni manages the house by herself.

1188
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,958
Doesn't let me do a thing.

1189
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:17,125
Money isn't a concern either.

1190
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:20,041
Please stop lying, Ma.

1191
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:23,750
Please.

1192
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:38,875
The next time you're home,
you'll be in uniform, won't you?

1193
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:01,875
It'll be okay, my son.

1194
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:29,375
Don't cry, Ma.

1195
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:41,875
Along with studying,
Manoj sent money home.

1196
01:23:43,375 --> 01:23:46,583
He worked all day at the flour mill,

1197
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:49,625
and studied through the night.

1198
01:23:54,458 --> 01:23:56,583
-Brother Gauri?
-Look who's here.

1199
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:57,458
Who?

1200
01:23:57,583 --> 01:24:00,083
Sir, I'll go now. I'll bring breakfast.

1201
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,750
Papa?

1202
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,208
Please sit.

1203
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,333
Here.

1204
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:29,958
I'll get water.

1205
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:41,125
What brings you to Delhi?

1206
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:43,750
I've come to take you home.

1207
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:46,458
Let's go.

1208
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:49,833
What is this hellhole you're living in?

1209
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:53,000
Let's both go home.

1210
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:57,333
We'll sell government seeds
on the black market

1211
01:24:58,083 --> 01:25:00,291
and make lots of money.

1212
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:05,916
What are you saying, Papa?

1213
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:12,583
My mother died and no one told me.

1214
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,500
Because I was busy with my fight.

1215
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:22,291
I believed if I fought dishonesty,
honesty would win.

1216
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:28,708
But your mother was always right.

1217
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,583
I'm just a fool.

1218
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:36,083
I've ruined my family, for honesty.

1219
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:40,125
I've decided.

1220
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:42,583
Let's go back home.

1221
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:46,083
I'll fall at Chauhan's feet.
Get my job back.

1222
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:50,458
-Sign any file he gives me.
-No!

1223
01:25:50,708 --> 01:25:53,375
Come, son, pack your things.

1224
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,958
Enough fighting for honesty.

1225
01:25:56,708 --> 01:25:58,083
It's worthless!

1226
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:02,625
-Not entirely worthless.
-It is!

1227
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:07,333
People like us will never win.

1228
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:14,208
Nor will we accept defeat, right?

1229
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:17,333
Papa...

1230
01:26:21,958 --> 01:26:23,458
Don't you remember?

1231
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:31,833
I won't accept defeat,
I'm not that easy to beat

1232
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:35,875
I won't accept defeat,
I'm not that easy to beat

1233
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:41,208
I won't accept defeat,
I'm not that easy to beat

1234
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:45,458
I'll write a new rhyme,
On the pages of time

1235
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:51,000
I'll sing a new song...

1236
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:58,458
-Sing a new song...
-It'll all be okay.

1237
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,166
It'll all work out.

1238
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:09,500
It'll all work out fine.

1239
01:27:16,375 --> 01:27:18,291
-Water...
-Yes.

1240
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:25,125
Papa, don't worry about money
or our home.

1241
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:26,958
I'll take care of it.

1242
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:29,958
Keep fighting. I'm with you.

1243
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:32,375
Here.

1244
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:44,375
After that, Manoj worked day and night.

1245
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:48,541
He'd grind flour for 15 hours a day,

1246
01:27:48,541 --> 01:27:50,625
study for six

1247
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:52,708
and sleep for three.

1248
01:27:56,833 --> 01:27:58,666
Then one day...

1249
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:01,625
What good is a date palm tree
for a traveller?

1250
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:05,041
It has no shade for the weary
and no fruit they can reach.

1251
01:28:05,458 --> 01:28:07,875
You must've heard of the poet Kabir Das?

1252
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:12,500
From a 1000-year history of Hindi poetry,
if I had to choose a poet,

1253
01:28:12,916 --> 01:28:14,833
who wrote fearlessly and freely

1254
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:17,958
about everyone alike,
king, priest or commoner...

1255
01:28:18,041 --> 01:28:20,208
who spared none
and saw through them all,

1256
01:28:20,291 --> 01:28:21,791
I would choose Kabir.

1257
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:23,500
A revolutionary poet...

1258
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:24,875
She had called.

1259
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:26,875
She was asking about you.

1260
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,166
Why didn't you tell me?

1261
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,375
I forgot. Must be drunk.

1262
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:34,625
Welcome back, Shraddha.
Make some space for her.

1263
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:36,000
How were your Prelims?

1264
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:38,375
-Excellent, sir.
-Very good. Take a seat.

1265
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:40,500
We're studying Kabir's poetry.

1266
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:42,416
Stop drinking, Pandey.

1267
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:46,000
Stop acting like my father!

1268
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,125
-Hi, Pandey!
-Hey, Shraddha.

1269
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,416
Where's Manoj?

1270
01:28:54,791 --> 01:28:57,291
Inside. Go, meet him.

1271
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:14,916
Hi, Manoj!

1272
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:16,750
Hi!

1273
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:20,625
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1274
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,291
How are you?

1275
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:26,708
I'm sorry, Manoj.

1276
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,208
It's okay.

1277
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:33,250
No, it's not.
I shouldn't have been so rude.

1278
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:38,666
I was shocked when you showed up
suddenly... it was hard to...

1279
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:43,583
I called back a minute later, but...

1280
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:47,000
But... you were gone.

1281
01:29:49,666 --> 01:29:52,708
I'm really sorry, Manoj.
I was very rude to you that day.

1282
01:29:52,791 --> 01:29:55,250
Thank you for being rude.

1283
01:29:57,833 --> 01:29:59,583
This is no time for love.

1284
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:02,458
I have to focus on studying.

1285
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:08,583
I have responsibilities.

1286
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:12,541
Pandey told me.

1287
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:13,750
What?

1288
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:15,875
Everything.

1289
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:19,833
About your family...
your father's struggle.

1290
01:30:20,375 --> 01:30:22,208
About your grandma.

1291
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:25,250
I better go.

1292
01:30:27,833 --> 01:30:31,000
Manoj, can we go and talk somewhere?

1293
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:32,958
Can we talk after my Prelims?

1294
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:36,041
But that's two months away--

1295
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:45,958
All the best, Manoj!

1296
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:48,583
Thank you.

1297
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:52,958
Shraddha couldn't meet Manoj for months.

1298
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:56,291
He studied day and night
while working in the flour mill.

1299
01:30:57,458 --> 01:30:59,500
Then came the Prelims result.

1300
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:02,208
I failed for the third time.

1301
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:05,666
Papa, I didn't make it. I worked so hard.

1302
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:08,458
I'm trying...

1303
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:11,416
-Pandey, listen!
-I am working hard, Papa-ji.

1304
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:13,666
I finally cleared the Prelims.

1305
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,541
I don't give a damn!

1306
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:19,708
Papa, I still have one last attempt,
I'll get through.

1307
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:22,916
-Sorry.
-Pandey!

1308
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,541
-Where's Manoj?
-I'm on the phone!

1309
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:25,583
Where's Manoj?

1310
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:27,333
How the hell should I know?

1311
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,583
He cleared his Prelims.

1312
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:32,750
Does he even know?
Where is he?

1313
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:43,958
Stop here, please.

1314
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:49,750
Tell me.

1315
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:54,250
Shraddha?

1316
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,666
-Manoj!
-What're you doing here?

1317
01:31:56,666 --> 01:31:59,291
Congratulations!
You cleared your Prelims.

1318
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:01,125
Obviously! I knew it.

1319
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:06,291
-Can you stop this noise please?
-Yes. Sorry.

1320
01:32:13,166 --> 01:32:15,333
Let me just... sorry...

1321
01:32:15,583 --> 01:32:17,083
Move a bit, please.

1322
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:29,875
Sit.

1323
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:38,500
After the exam,
I checked every answer.

1324
01:32:38,666 --> 01:32:40,666
We need to score 98 to pass.

1325
01:32:40,833 --> 01:32:44,541
Out of the 200 questions, I got 164 right.

1326
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:48,041
Watch me, I'll clear the Mains, too.

1327
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:53,833
The Mains don't have multiple-choice
questions.

1328
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:55,958
You'll need to write many essays.

1329
01:32:56,041 --> 01:32:58,208
If you don't make time,
prepare adequately--

1330
01:32:58,291 --> 01:33:01,625
I know all that. I'll manage.

1331
01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:05,916
How will you manage?

1332
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:11,625
Pandey said, you work 15 hours a day.

1333
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:15,250
How will you... manage?

1334
01:33:17,416 --> 01:33:20,458
Manoj, I have a request.

1335
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:22,291
Stop working here.

1336
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:26,333
-I will lend you some money. Return it--
-No, I don't need money!

1337
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:27,583
Please.

1338
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:30,833
If you don't need money,
why work here?

1339
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:34,958
When I returned from Mussoorie,
you said, you'd meet me after the Prelims.

1340
01:33:34,958 --> 01:33:38,000
You'd focus on studying.
You said that, right?

1341
01:33:38,041 --> 01:33:40,291
Then focus, dammit!
What the hell--

1342
01:33:40,333 --> 01:33:43,958
You won't understand.
We come from different worlds!

1343
01:33:54,541 --> 01:33:56,208
Sorry, I...

1344
01:34:22,791 --> 01:34:26,833
Shraddha, my mother is all by herself...
managing everything.

1345
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:30,458
My father is in court fighting corruption.

1346
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:33,541
My elder brother...

1347
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:35,791
is a daily-wage earner
in a distant village.

1348
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:42,041
I have responsibilities.

1349
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:50,125
I understand, Manoj...

1350
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:55,208
but how will you study
in this darkness?

1351
01:34:57,583 --> 01:34:58,875
Papa always said...

1352
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:02,291
"I don't fear the darkness outside,
but the one within.

1353
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:05,666
"The darkness of compromises
one makes for comforts."

1354
01:35:05,791 --> 01:35:07,583
-But Manoj--
-And you already know...

1355
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:11,041
Dr Abdul Kalam studied
under a street lamp.

1356
01:35:11,291 --> 01:35:14,166
I have my own bulb.

1357
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,708
He did have his own bulb.

1358
01:35:18,416 --> 01:35:21,125
But in the Mains exam,

1359
01:35:21,416 --> 01:35:24,791
out of 20 questions,
he could barely finish 12.

1360
01:35:25,166 --> 01:35:28,916
And when the results came
the outcome was no surprise.

1361
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:34,291
Manoj Kumar Sharma
failed his third attempt as well.

1362
01:35:36,541 --> 01:35:39,750
But despite that,
in the middle of the night,

1363
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:43,333
she was sitting with him
at the Restart Tea Stall.

1364
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:46,041
Holding his hand.

1365
01:35:47,458 --> 01:35:49,541
I couldn't bear it.

1366
01:35:49,791 --> 01:35:52,666
My man Naval cleared the Mains.

1367
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:54,958
What a party we've had!

1368
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,791
Brother Gauri, it was epic.

1369
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:58,625
Fantastic.

1370
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:00,291
-Congratulations, Naval!
-Thank you.

1371
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:01,541
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

1372
01:36:01,666 --> 01:36:03,041
-Congratulations, Naval!
-Thanks.

1373
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:06,833
But shouldn't you party
after the final selection?

1374
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:12,791
I've celebrated often after the Mains.

1375
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:16,041
Brother Gauri, don't worry about Naval.

1376
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:20,666
His selection is a given.
Ask me why?

1377
01:36:21,291 --> 01:36:22,333
Why?

1378
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:27,083
Because in his life,
he has no Shraddha to distract him.

1379
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:29,125
Shraddha, don't be upset.

1380
01:36:29,291 --> 01:36:35,083
But the fact is, if you two had not met,
Manoj would've cleared his Mains.

1381
01:36:35,166 --> 01:36:36,166
Pandey!

1382
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:39,708
If you can't be nice,
at least be quiet.

1383
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:43,958
But am I wrong?
I'm saying it for Manoj's own good.

1384
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:47,916
Listen, if you remain a nobody,
she'll walk away.

1385
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:53,041
The way Tanya walked away.

1386
01:36:53,458 --> 01:36:54,833
She just left.

1387
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:02,958
No one wants to be with a loser.

1388
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:06,250
Get it?

1389
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:10,500
Manoj?

1390
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:12,500
Look at me.

1391
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:16,166
Let's say, you meet this woman
ten years later and she asks,

1392
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:18,375
"Dear Manoj,
what are you doing these days?"

1393
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:19,458
What will you say?

1394
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:21,291
"I am working at a flour mill."

1395
01:37:21,416 --> 01:37:24,458
Or "I'm running a rickshaw
between Morena and Jaura."

1396
01:37:24,541 --> 01:37:26,541
-Pandey.
-Will she want to be with you?

1397
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:30,541
-You're drunk. And talking nonsense.
-I'm trying to drill sense into him.

1398
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:35,041
All girls are the same.

1399
01:37:35,041 --> 01:37:36,666
No one wants to be with a loser.

1400
01:37:37,291 --> 01:37:38,875
She'll be gone in minutes.

1401
01:37:38,958 --> 01:37:40,083
Shraddha!

1402
01:37:40,208 --> 01:37:42,833
-See? Gone in minutes.
-Shraddha!

1403
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:45,791
Shraddha, listen...

1404
01:37:46,458 --> 01:37:48,791
Remember what you said?

1405
01:37:48,875 --> 01:37:52,958
That you'd turn the world upside down
if I said, I love you.

1406
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,041
Manoj...

1407
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:05,375
I love you.

1408
01:38:13,708 --> 01:38:17,500
Now go and turn the world upside down.

1409
01:38:56,791 --> 01:38:59,416
Stop him!
Hey, where do you think you're going?

1410
01:39:02,916 --> 01:39:06,041
Deep sir knows me.

1411
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:10,083
-Sir... I'm Manoj.
-Sir, he just ran in...

1412
01:39:10,166 --> 01:39:12,833
-Relax. Who are you?
-Sir, Manoj.

1413
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:16,875
I got coffee to Tanya's terrace.
You called me a tea-boy. Remember?

1414
01:39:18,416 --> 01:39:19,708
-Oh... Manoj.
-Yes, sir.

1415
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:20,833
Leave him.

1416
01:39:22,041 --> 01:39:22,958
Tell me.

1417
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:25,291
Sir, I need your help.
It's my last attempt.

1418
01:39:25,708 --> 01:39:26,666
Not now, Manoj. I'm busy.

1419
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:28,208
-Please, sir.
-Some other time?

1420
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:31,541
You had said, you owe me.

1421
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:34,125
Please, sir.
Just five minutes.

1422
01:39:34,541 --> 01:39:35,708
Please, sir.

1423
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:37,958
Come in.

1424
01:39:39,708 --> 01:39:42,083
Check the pointers
and draft the letter to the Home Ministry.

1425
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:43,458
-Okay, sir.
-Don't miss anything.

1426
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:44,458
Yes, sir.

1427
01:39:44,541 --> 01:39:45,958
I have to deal with something.

1428
01:39:50,666 --> 01:39:52,583
You first, sir.

1429
01:39:54,916 --> 01:39:55,833
Talk.

1430
01:39:55,916 --> 01:39:59,958
Sir, I get through the Prelims
but the Mains are a challenge.

1431
01:40:00,666 --> 01:40:01,791
It's my last attempt, sir.

1432
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:03,750
Rote learning is enough for Prelims.

1433
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:05,541
You just have to check the right box.

1434
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,666
But it doesn't work for the Mains.

1435
01:40:07,916 --> 01:40:09,041
I'll manage it, sir.

1436
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:10,541
3 hours, 20 questions.

1437
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:12,666
That's 9 minutes to write an answer
within 200 words.

1438
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:15,041
So, you'll take 40 seconds to analyze,
strategize, construct--

1439
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:18,625
Sir, a little slower, please?

1440
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:21,166
I'm saying out of 9 minutes,

1441
01:40:21,291 --> 01:40:25,041
you will take 40 seconds to analyze,
strategize, construct your answer.

1442
01:40:25,166 --> 01:40:29,291
Giving you 8 minutes 20 seconds
to actually write it, within 200 words.

1443
01:40:29,416 --> 01:40:31,583
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

1444
01:40:31,958 --> 01:40:33,458
4,000 words per exam.

1445
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,791
Nine exams in total.

1446
01:40:34,916 --> 01:40:37,500
That's 36,000 words, Manoj.

1447
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:39,208
You only think you can manage it.

1448
01:40:39,208 --> 01:40:41,291
But I can, sir.

1449
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:43,416
-Prakash?
-Yes, sir?

1450
01:40:43,708 --> 01:40:45,416
Get me a pen and paper.

1451
01:40:52,208 --> 01:40:54,583
-Now, show me.
-Sir, tea or coffee?

1452
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:57,208
Sorry, sir.

1453
01:40:59,291 --> 01:41:02,458
You have 8 minutes and 20 seconds.
Write 200 words.

1454
01:41:02,791 --> 01:41:03,666
What topic, sir?

1455
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:05,541
-What's your full name?
-Manoj Kumar Sharma.

1456
01:41:05,666 --> 01:41:08,041
"Manoj Kumar Sharma."
That's your topic.

1457
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:10,833
But that's too easy, sir.

1458
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:12,708
Then start writing.

1459
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:16,583
Your time starts now.

1460
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:19,750
Guys, where are we?

1461
01:41:33,458 --> 01:41:34,583
So get this done.

1462
01:41:35,541 --> 01:41:37,291
Right now! And give me a minute.

1463
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:43,416
-Time.
-Sir, just a minute...

1464
01:41:46,666 --> 01:41:48,875
It was too easy for you, right?

1465
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:50,541
Manoj Kumar Sharma.

1466
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:55,708
On a topic you know so well...

1467
01:41:55,791 --> 01:41:58,583
you couldn't write
more than 90 words.

1468
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:03,416
How on earth will you write 200 words
on International Relations,

1469
01:42:03,666 --> 01:42:07,791
Internal Security,
Social Justice, Governance?

1470
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:13,125
I don't mean to demean you.

1471
01:42:15,958 --> 01:42:17,416
But you can't do it.

1472
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:21,666
"You can't do it."

1473
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:23,416
Get out of your air-conditioned cabin...

1474
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:25,708
work all day at a flour mill, Deep Mohan.

1475
01:42:25,708 --> 01:42:28,541
Then pass your judgements.

1476
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:31,916
Manoj, drop that.

1477
01:42:32,708 --> 01:42:33,791
Stop all this.

1478
01:42:33,958 --> 01:42:35,041
What happened?

1479
01:42:35,333 --> 01:42:37,041
You can't do it.

1480
01:42:37,291 --> 01:42:39,958
If you keep serving tea,
and grinding flour,

1481
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:41,375
you'll never make it.

1482
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,875
But I don't have a choice.

1483
01:42:44,041 --> 01:42:46,041
You don't get it. Come here.

1484
01:42:46,125 --> 01:42:47,291
Clear my room out.

1485
01:42:47,416 --> 01:42:49,833
-Move Manoj's stuff into it.
-What?

1486
01:42:49,916 --> 01:42:52,291
No more serving tea. I'll manage.

1487
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:53,166
No, Brother Gauri.

1488
01:42:53,291 --> 01:42:56,000
He must get his meals on time,
look after him.

1489
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,916
And you! From now on,
all you'll do is study.

1490
01:42:59,041 --> 01:43:00,583
No more grinding flour.

1491
01:43:00,666 --> 01:43:01,916
I'll send your family money.

1492
01:43:01,916 --> 01:43:02,875
No, Brother...

1493
01:43:02,958 --> 01:43:05,041
I'm not doing you a favour.

1494
01:43:05,291 --> 01:43:08,208
It's a loan. I'll take back double
from your first salary.

1495
01:43:08,208 --> 01:43:10,750
-No, Brother!
-Shut up!

1496
01:43:11,541 --> 01:43:14,125
Another word and I'll bury you
right here.

1497
01:43:15,166 --> 01:43:18,291
What do you think?
It's just your fight?

1498
01:43:18,708 --> 01:43:20,458
It's our fight!

1499
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:24,291
Even if one of us wins,

1500
01:43:24,666 --> 01:43:26,583
the whole herd wins.

1501
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:30,916
And if you still don't get it,
I'll give you one!

1502
01:43:35,541 --> 01:43:39,416
Restart. Restart.

1503
01:43:39,541 --> 01:43:40,666
Bro...

1504
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:44,041
Tutul, move his stuff to my room now.

1505
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:45,041
-Right now?
-Now!

1506
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:50,541
That was the first time in his life
Manoj had a table to study on,

1507
01:43:50,916 --> 01:43:52,666
an electric stove,

1508
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:55,458
and a bed to sleep on.

1509
01:43:57,291 --> 01:43:58,541
And the next morning...

1510
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:01,291
Excuse me?
Does Manoj Kumar Sharma live here?

1511
01:44:01,958 --> 01:44:03,916
He was given a stopwatch.

1512
01:44:05,041 --> 01:44:06,333
My father gave it to me.

1513
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:07,916
It has only one rule.

1514
01:44:08,083 --> 01:44:09,791
Start when you sit to study.

1515
01:44:09,916 --> 01:44:12,041
Stop it when you take a break.

1516
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:13,750
No cheating.

1517
01:44:13,916 --> 01:44:16,958
It should run for 16 hours a day.
16 hours of studying.

1518
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:18,916
-How many hours?
-16 hours, ma'am.

1519
01:44:18,916 --> 01:44:19,958
Correct!

1520
01:44:20,208 --> 01:44:22,125
Then write.

1521
01:44:23,083 --> 01:44:24,833
Here... start!

1522
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:28,041
Don't like the life that you live

1523
01:44:28,291 --> 01:44:30,791
Live the life that you like!

1524
01:44:30,916 --> 01:44:33,708
Shraddha sent you these notes.

1525
01:44:34,083 --> 01:44:35,458
And here's dinner.

1526
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:37,666
She said to eat it in 8 minutes
and 20 seconds.

1527
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:40,583
-Why?
-So that you digest the timing, too!

1528
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:43,083
Thank you, Tutul.

1529
01:44:43,083 --> 01:44:46,041
Don't like the life that you live

1530
01:44:46,166 --> 01:44:48,583
Live the life that you like!

1531
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:51,791
Don't give up before you fight,

1532
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:55,041
Give yourself chance to strike!

1533
01:44:55,166 --> 01:44:58,083
Strike, man, strike

1534
01:44:58,166 --> 01:45:02,458
Strike, man, strike

1535
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:14,666
-Hi!
-Hi!

1536
01:45:15,666 --> 01:45:18,166
Question papers from the last 10 years.

1537
01:45:18,291 --> 01:45:20,958
-I'm going to Mussoorie.
-Why?

1538
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:23,291
For my PCS Mains, idiot!

1539
01:45:24,041 --> 01:45:25,416
Is it July already?

1540
01:45:28,916 --> 01:45:31,291
Restart. Restart.

1541
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:37,541
I love you!

1542
01:45:46,416 --> 01:45:48,791
Night was spent scratching the head

1543
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:51,791
Blind feet find no path ahead

1544
01:45:52,416 --> 01:45:55,291
Bring on some light,
Dispel the night!

1545
01:45:55,333 --> 01:45:58,291
When blues you spurn,
Tables will turn,

1546
01:45:58,416 --> 01:46:04,166
Then with all your heart,
Restart!

1547
01:46:08,208 --> 01:46:09,291
Manoj?

1548
01:46:09,833 --> 01:46:11,458
Hey, Manoj?

1549
01:46:12,166 --> 01:46:13,291
Wake up!

1550
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:17,125
There's good news. Shraddha called.

1551
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:21,083
She cleared her Mains.
Her interview is next month.

1552
01:46:22,208 --> 01:46:25,708
I also spoke to your mother.
She received the money.

1553
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:27,666
-Happy?
-Very.

1554
01:46:28,333 --> 01:46:29,541
Thank you!

1555
01:46:30,208 --> 01:46:32,666
Remember, double the amount
from your first salary.

1556
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:34,916
Freshen up and get back to studying.

1557
01:46:35,541 --> 01:46:37,708
Restart. Restart.

1558
01:46:39,208 --> 01:46:41,041
Let's hear it!
Restart. Restart.

1559
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:43,291
Louder!

1560
01:46:43,416 --> 01:46:44,958
Start from zero!

1561
01:46:47,208 --> 01:46:49,083
Restart from zero!

1562
01:46:50,541 --> 01:46:52,083
Come on, man!

1563
01:46:52,416 --> 01:46:56,166
[You can't do it.]

1564
01:47:03,291 --> 01:47:05,791
Restart. Restart.

1565
01:47:11,708 --> 01:47:14,541
Shraddha is waiting. Come! Run!

1566
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:16,791
-Where?
-The power supply is back, run!

1567
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:18,583
-Where to?
-Just come.

1568
01:47:19,208 --> 01:47:22,041
Congratulate your parents as well.
He's here.

1569
01:47:23,041 --> 01:47:23,916
Hello?

1570
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:26,333
Manoj, I've cleared the interview!

1571
01:47:26,541 --> 01:47:27,541
Meaning?

1572
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:30,708
Meaning, Shraddha has become
a Deputy Collector!

1573
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:33,708
Got it? Or do I need to spell it out?

1574
01:47:33,791 --> 01:47:38,000
His motivation had now become
his inspiration.

1575
01:47:38,541 --> 01:47:41,791
He was turning pages
of his answer book,

1576
01:47:41,875 --> 01:47:44,375
as if he was turning the world
upside down.

1577
01:47:47,291 --> 01:47:48,291
And I?

1578
01:47:48,666 --> 01:47:50,958
I failed my final attempt too.

1579
01:47:51,041 --> 01:47:55,125
-Papa, I really worked hard...
-Shut up! It's my money wasted.

1580
01:47:55,208 --> 01:47:56,541
I'm sorry, Papa. I...

1581
01:47:56,833 --> 01:48:00,291
Please don't shout.
I tried my best.

1582
01:48:00,416 --> 01:48:02,041
I gave it my all. Please...

1583
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:04,791
-Pandey?
-But maybe it's not for me...

1584
01:48:04,833 --> 01:48:07,833
-You're absolutely useless!
-Please don't say that.

1585
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:10,833
Do what you want.
I don't care anymore!

1586
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:13,666
Pandey, give me your phone.
I need to call Shraddha.

1587
01:48:13,791 --> 01:48:16,208
-Did you pass?
-Yes! I did.

1588
01:48:16,791 --> 01:48:17,916
Well done.

1589
01:48:18,458 --> 01:48:20,666
You want to call Shraddha?
Here you go.

1590
01:48:21,791 --> 01:48:24,041
You could've asked about me...

1591
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:27,083
I failed.

1592
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,541
It's all over.

1593
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:31,708
But you don't give a damn, do you?

1594
01:48:33,666 --> 01:48:36,375
You didn't even know
what the U in UPSC meant.

1595
01:48:36,541 --> 01:48:37,958
I brought you to Delhi.

1596
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:41,833
I gave you a place to live.
These clothes you're wearing, I gave you.

1597
01:48:42,458 --> 01:48:44,458
And you won't even ask about me?

1598
01:48:45,541 --> 01:48:47,791
You want to call Shraddha?
With my phone?

1599
01:48:47,916 --> 01:48:50,166
I didn't buy this phone for the two of you.

1600
01:48:50,291 --> 01:48:52,041
You and your girlfriend can go to hell!

1601
01:48:52,166 --> 01:48:53,708
Not a word against Shraddha.

1602
01:48:55,083 --> 01:48:57,958
If you have the balls,
go confront your father.

1603
01:48:58,166 --> 01:49:01,458
Don't you dare drag my father
into this, Manoj!

1604
01:49:01,666 --> 01:49:03,166
We're all extremely happy, Ma'am.

1605
01:49:03,416 --> 01:49:06,666
No, He's not an officer yet.
There's still the interview.

1606
01:49:06,916 --> 01:49:08,458
After that he will...

1607
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:10,166
Your son is here.

1608
01:49:10,416 --> 01:49:12,166
Quickly... it's your mother.

1609
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:14,541
Tutul, get sweets.

1610
01:49:14,583 --> 01:49:16,791
-Yes, Ma!
-Congratulations, son!

1611
01:49:16,916 --> 01:49:18,125
Thank you, Ma.

1612
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:20,416
-How's Papa?
-He's very happy.

1613
01:49:20,416 --> 01:49:22,666
He's been happier since he met you.

1614
01:49:23,166 --> 01:49:25,708
He's gone to the Gwalior High Court,
to appeal again.

1615
01:49:26,083 --> 01:49:28,166
One minute, speak to Rajni.

1616
01:49:28,291 --> 01:49:30,625
-Congratulations, Brother!
-Thank you, Rajni!

1617
01:49:30,708 --> 01:49:32,750
My little brother, becoming too big!

1618
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:34,500
Thank you, Brother!

1619
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,166
Listen, I need to make an urgent call.

1620
01:49:36,291 --> 01:49:38,041
Already busy like an officer!

1621
01:49:38,041 --> 01:49:41,708
Not at all. I know you'll understand.
I'll call later. Bye.

1622
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:43,250
One minute, hello!

1623
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:44,958
-Manoj? Hello?
-I want to speak to him.

1624
01:49:45,041 --> 01:49:46,583
He hung up.

1625
01:49:47,041 --> 01:49:48,208
He's a busy man now.

1626
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:57,916
-Hello?
-Hello, Shraddha, I cleared my Mains!

1627
01:49:58,166 --> 01:49:59,666
Congratulations!

1628
01:49:59,791 --> 01:50:01,166
This is Shraddha's mother.

1629
01:50:01,458 --> 01:50:02,916
Namaste!

1630
01:50:03,083 --> 01:50:05,666
Sorry, I thought it was Shraddha.
This is Manoj from Delhi.

1631
01:50:05,916 --> 01:50:08,041
-Yes, I've understood.
-May I speak to her?

1632
01:50:08,208 --> 01:50:11,375
She's not home. I'll tell her to call you.

1633
01:50:11,416 --> 01:50:15,166
Yes, Aunty. Please tell her.
I'll be waiting.

1634
01:50:15,291 --> 01:50:16,125
Of course.

1635
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:33,250
Why did you lie to him?

1636
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:52,291
Hello?

1637
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,791
Hello? Manoj?

1638
01:50:54,166 --> 01:50:55,791
Congratulations!

1639
01:50:56,666 --> 01:50:57,958
Thank you, Shraddha.

1640
01:50:58,083 --> 01:50:59,708
Sorry, it took me so long.

1641
01:50:59,958 --> 01:51:00,750
Never mind.

1642
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:03,291
You're coming to Delhi, right?
For my interview?

1643
01:51:03,458 --> 01:51:05,500
I won't be able to, Manoj.

1644
01:51:05,916 --> 01:51:07,041
Why not?

1645
01:51:07,291 --> 01:51:09,583
Someone called Papa and said I...

1646
01:51:11,083 --> 01:51:12,750
I was sleeping with you in Delhi.

1647
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:13,791
What?

1648
01:51:13,916 --> 01:51:16,416
Why would anyone do that?

1649
01:51:16,583 --> 01:51:18,041
It doesn't matter.

1650
01:51:18,541 --> 01:51:22,041
What matters is Papa chose to believe
a stranger.

1651
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:24,041
How can she tell him?

1652
01:51:24,833 --> 01:51:26,250
Ridiculous!

1653
01:51:27,291 --> 01:51:30,500
Shraddha, let me talk to your father.
Let me explain--

1654
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:34,041
Forget all this.
Just focus on your interview.

1655
01:51:45,166 --> 01:51:47,000
-Hello?
-Pandey, where the hell are you?

1656
01:51:47,083 --> 01:51:49,666
Someone has called for you, finally.

1657
01:51:49,833 --> 01:51:51,041
Come and get your friend.

1658
01:51:51,291 --> 01:51:52,666
Hello? Who are you?

1659
01:51:53,041 --> 01:51:54,666
Just come and get your friend.

1660
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:55,791
From?

1661
01:51:56,041 --> 01:51:57,458
Mukherjee Nagar police station.

1662
01:51:57,541 --> 01:51:58,916
Your friend is in big trouble.

1663
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:13,750
Manoj, no one else showed up.
Only you!

1664
01:52:13,833 --> 01:52:16,583
Yes? Your name?

1665
01:52:16,916 --> 01:52:19,291
-Manoj Kumar--
-Manoj Kumar Sharma, sir. My friend.

1666
01:52:19,416 --> 01:52:24,958
Your friend was drunk and shouting abuses
on the phone in public.

1667
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:27,291
I wasn't abusing, Manoj,
I finally told Papa...

1668
01:52:27,291 --> 01:52:29,166
-No IAS for me.
-Quiet!

1669
01:52:29,166 --> 01:52:30,958
-No dirty money!
-Shut up!

1670
01:52:31,083 --> 01:52:33,041
-But you said--
-Enough!

1671
01:52:36,458 --> 01:52:37,458
So...

1672
01:52:39,541 --> 01:52:41,083
Tell me, what has he done?

1673
01:52:41,083 --> 01:52:43,833
He was shouting in a public place
and was abusive.

1674
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:46,625
I told him to calm down,
so he started shouting at me.

1675
01:52:48,083 --> 01:52:49,833
At a police officer!

1676
01:52:50,166 --> 01:52:51,375
Did he hit you?

1677
01:52:51,791 --> 01:52:53,791
He wouldn't dare.
I would've clobbered him.

1678
01:52:54,166 --> 01:52:56,333
-Did he abuse you?
-He was creating a racket.

1679
01:52:56,666 --> 01:52:57,625
Did he hit anyone?

1680
01:52:57,625 --> 01:53:00,291
Should I have waited for that?

1681
01:53:02,166 --> 01:53:04,875
Under which IPC section
have you arrested him?

1682
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:07,666
-Section?
-Yes.

1683
01:53:08,208 --> 01:53:11,000
He was drunk. A public nuisance.
Hurling abuses!

1684
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,750
That's a non-cognizable offense.

1685
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:15,875
Did you get a magistrate
to issue an arrest warrant?

1686
01:53:17,458 --> 01:53:20,375
-He has damaged public property!
-Manoj, he's lying!

1687
01:53:20,375 --> 01:53:22,791
He paid a fine of 3000.
He must pay 2000 more.

1688
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:24,208
Show me the evidence.

1689
01:53:24,333 --> 01:53:25,666
Show me the evidence.

1690
01:53:26,333 --> 01:53:29,541
Arresting someone for a
non-cognizable offence without a warrant

1691
01:53:29,666 --> 01:53:32,791
and claiming property damage
without evidence are both illegal.

1692
01:53:32,916 --> 01:53:34,458
I'm sure you're aware.

1693
01:53:37,958 --> 01:53:40,083
He has to pay the fine.

1694
01:53:42,166 --> 01:53:44,625
It's not a fine. It's a bribe.

1695
01:53:45,416 --> 01:53:47,250
It's called corruption.

1696
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:48,875
Don't cross the line...

1697
01:53:48,958 --> 01:53:50,958
I've barely begun.

1698
01:53:51,083 --> 01:53:52,958
-I'm from Chambal. Get it?
-Hey...

1699
01:53:53,041 --> 01:53:56,333
You're asking for a bribe
in front of an eyewitness.

1700
01:53:57,041 --> 01:54:00,000
Your senior sitting there,
who can hear you

1701
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:01,625
is an eyewitness.

1702
01:54:02,333 --> 01:54:03,791
I've cleared my Mains today.

1703
01:54:03,916 --> 01:54:05,791
My interview is in a month.

1704
01:54:06,541 --> 01:54:08,291
If I become an IPS officer,

1705
01:54:09,416 --> 01:54:11,791
the first document I sign
will be your suspension.

1706
01:54:11,916 --> 01:54:13,750
Remember that.

1707
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:16,541
What's going on?

1708
01:54:16,958 --> 01:54:19,041
-Sir, this--
-Let him go with a warning.

1709
01:54:22,166 --> 01:54:23,833
Sir, he's taken a bribe of 3,000.

1710
01:54:25,041 --> 01:54:26,791
-Give it back.
-But, sir...

1711
01:54:27,166 --> 01:54:28,333
Give it back!

1712
01:54:31,458 --> 01:54:33,083
Let him go.

1713
01:54:33,416 --> 01:54:35,583
Manoj, that was amazing!

1714
01:54:35,583 --> 01:54:39,583
This is the first time
I've seen a cop return a bribe.

1715
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:41,041
Give me your phone.

1716
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:43,291
Want to speak to Shraddha?

1717
01:54:43,416 --> 01:54:45,416
Talk to her the whole night.

1718
01:54:45,583 --> 01:54:47,000
Tell her what just happened.

1719
01:54:47,083 --> 01:54:50,791
Non-cognizable, section, IPC...

1720
01:54:50,916 --> 01:54:52,125
What is this?

1721
01:54:52,125 --> 01:54:53,666
You called her father?

1722
01:54:54,291 --> 01:54:55,666
What the hell is this?

1723
01:54:56,416 --> 01:54:58,333
Bro, I made a mistake.

1724
01:54:58,833 --> 01:55:01,083
Don't show me your face again.

1725
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:03,541
-Sorry--
-Got it?

1726
01:55:03,583 --> 01:55:06,791
You shouldn't have told Manoj
what your father said.

1727
01:55:07,291 --> 01:55:08,958
You really hurt him.

1728
01:55:09,916 --> 01:55:14,416
He believed a stranger's word, Mummy.
He really hurt me too.

1729
01:55:16,833 --> 01:55:18,458
Doesn't he trust me at all?

1730
01:55:18,458 --> 01:55:20,083
It's not that, my child.
He trusts you.

1731
01:55:20,166 --> 01:55:22,375
No, Mummy. He used to trust me.

1732
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:23,916
You remember?

1733
01:55:24,041 --> 01:55:26,083
How nervous I was when I told Papa

1734
01:55:26,166 --> 01:55:29,041
that I wanted to quit medical school
and join the civil services.

1735
01:55:29,041 --> 01:55:30,583
Everyone dissuaded him.

1736
01:55:30,666 --> 01:55:33,875
But what did he do?
He said, "Go to Delhi.

1737
01:55:33,958 --> 01:55:35,208
"Learn from the best."

1738
01:55:35,208 --> 01:55:37,250
He set me up to live independently.

1739
01:55:37,291 --> 01:55:39,708
Why? Because he trusted me.

1740
01:55:41,416 --> 01:55:43,583
Not anymore.

1741
01:55:44,541 --> 01:55:46,625
I still trust you, my child.

1742
01:55:46,916 --> 01:55:48,375
No, Papa. You don't.

1743
01:55:48,375 --> 01:55:50,666
I don't need your permission
to go to Delhi.

1744
01:55:50,666 --> 01:55:52,791
I'm a Deputy Collector.
Not a child anymore.

1745
01:55:53,166 --> 01:55:54,916
It's a big day for Manoj.

1746
01:55:55,041 --> 01:55:56,333
I want to be there for him.

1747
01:55:56,458 --> 01:55:59,541
Like you two are there for each other!

1748
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:04,791
But I would never do that.

1749
01:56:05,958 --> 01:56:08,208
Because I'll never break
your trust, Papa.

1750
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:14,291
Please, Papa. Please.

1751
01:56:37,583 --> 01:56:38,916
You must wear a tie.

1752
01:56:39,041 --> 01:56:41,041
A tie won't get me through the interview.

1753
01:56:41,166 --> 01:56:42,291
Not that again.

1754
01:56:42,583 --> 01:56:44,958
All the English-medium guys wore a tie.
I didn't.

1755
01:56:45,166 --> 01:56:47,291
Don't make the same mistake.

1756
01:56:47,375 --> 01:56:49,916
Brother Gauri, a tie won't get me selected--

1757
01:56:49,916 --> 01:56:52,666
-You have to wear it.
-Shraddha?

1758
01:56:52,666 --> 01:56:55,375
-You look so graceful.
-Thank you.

1759
01:56:55,375 --> 01:56:58,333
Talk some sense into him,
maybe he'll listen to you.

1760
01:56:58,541 --> 01:57:00,708
He can't ignore a Deputy Collector!

1761
01:57:00,833 --> 01:57:04,041
-And get him a haircut.
-Thank you, Brother Gauri.

1762
01:57:26,541 --> 01:57:27,916
The IAS or the IPS haircut?

1763
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:29,708
IPS.

1764
01:57:43,958 --> 01:57:47,791
I would drink all night.
And sleep all day.

1765
01:57:49,541 --> 01:57:53,541
I was just wasting away.

1766
01:57:55,916 --> 01:58:00,458
At that point, Manoj came back
into my life.

1767
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:03,250
I've come to thank you.

1768
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,875
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have made it this far.

1769
01:58:11,291 --> 01:58:12,833
Thank you, my friend.

1770
01:58:14,541 --> 01:58:17,833
Don't thank me from the doorstep,
come in!

1771
01:58:18,208 --> 01:58:19,416
Come.

1772
01:58:19,791 --> 01:58:23,791
-Sit.
-No! I have to rush for my interview.

1773
01:58:23,791 --> 01:58:25,250
Interview?

1774
01:58:25,791 --> 01:58:28,166
You came to see me
before your interview?

1775
01:58:31,958 --> 01:58:33,416
All the best, my friend!

1776
01:58:34,208 --> 01:58:36,541
-All the best!
-Thank you.

1777
01:58:38,666 --> 01:58:41,041
-Hi, Shraddha.
-Hi.

1778
01:58:42,166 --> 01:58:44,583
Shraddha, I'm really sorry...

1779
01:58:44,791 --> 01:58:46,666
I should never have called your father.

1780
01:58:46,791 --> 01:58:49,625
If you hadn't called
he wouldn't have said,

1781
01:58:49,625 --> 01:58:51,750
"I trust you! Go to Delhi."

1782
01:58:52,666 --> 01:58:54,166
Then I did well!

1783
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:56,333
He booked a private taxi for me.

1784
01:58:56,333 --> 01:58:59,458
What? Then I did really well!

1785
01:59:00,916 --> 01:59:03,583
By the way,
you lie so convincingly.

1786
01:59:03,583 --> 01:59:06,000
You should become a TV reporter.

1787
01:59:07,458 --> 01:59:09,458
-Me? On TV?
-Good idea.

1788
01:59:22,208 --> 01:59:24,041
How are you feeling?

1789
01:59:25,916 --> 01:59:27,416
The shoes are tight.

1790
01:59:29,666 --> 01:59:31,041
They pinch.

1791
01:59:31,416 --> 01:59:34,166
They're just new. It'll be fine.

1792
01:59:53,583 --> 01:59:54,541
What's this?

1793
01:59:55,666 --> 01:59:58,541
No! Not now.

1794
01:59:58,666 --> 02:00:00,291
Read it when you're alone.

1795
02:00:30,625 --> 02:00:31,791
This way.

1796
02:01:15,291 --> 02:01:16,833
This way.

1797
02:01:27,333 --> 02:01:28,458
Have a seat.

1798
02:01:53,541 --> 02:01:55,000
Tauheed Raza.

1799
02:02:01,916 --> 02:02:03,708
Rahul Gupta.

1800
02:02:10,166 --> 02:02:12,041
Alpana Bharti.

1801
02:02:19,166 --> 02:02:20,958
Khushiram Chaudhary.

1802
02:02:25,916 --> 02:02:27,791
Priyanshi Shrivastav.

1803
02:02:38,416 --> 02:02:39,916
Manoj Kumar Sharma.

1804
02:02:44,583 --> 02:02:46,083
Manoj Kumar Sharma.

1805
02:02:47,791 --> 02:02:49,416
Manoj Kumar Sharma.

1806
02:02:50,958 --> 02:02:52,791
Manoj Kumar Sharma?

1807
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:57,041
Manoj Kumar Sharma?

1808
02:02:57,916 --> 02:02:59,625
Yes, sir. It's me.

1809
02:03:03,833 --> 02:03:05,916
Did you take a gap year
in the 12th grade?

1810
02:03:06,666 --> 02:03:09,291
No, sir. I failed the first time around.

1811
02:03:11,125 --> 02:03:12,333
Take him.

1812
02:03:14,791 --> 02:03:17,250
I've been here for 40 years.
I know how it works.

1813
02:03:18,375 --> 02:03:20,625
Your chairman is Dr. Mehta.

1814
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:24,125
He's biased against Hindi-medium
students as it is.

1815
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:27,500
Don't say you actually failed the 12th!

1816
02:03:28,375 --> 02:03:32,166
Just say your grandmother passed away
that year.

1817
02:03:33,041 --> 02:03:34,791
Got it?

1818
02:03:35,041 --> 02:03:36,583
Go. Do well.

1819
02:03:46,041 --> 02:03:48,250
Namaste, sir. Namaste, ma'am.

1820
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:50,500
Namaste!

1821
02:03:53,500 --> 02:03:54,625
Please sit.

1822
02:03:57,375 --> 02:03:59,750
This is Mr. Manoj Kumar Sharma.

1823
02:04:00,041 --> 02:04:02,666
He's from Bilgaon.
That's in Chambal.

1824
02:04:03,625 --> 02:04:05,750
Notorious for dacoits.

1825
02:04:07,875 --> 02:04:11,208
Mr. Sharma has graduated
in History and Hindi Literature

1826
02:04:11,208 --> 02:04:13,291
in the 2nd division.

1827
02:04:14,125 --> 02:04:16,583
He has a 1st division in 10th grade.

1828
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:20,541
And a 3rd division in 12th grade?

1829
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,125
Surprising!

1830
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:25,083
And... oh?

1831
02:04:26,125 --> 02:04:28,541
You failed the 12th grade?

1832
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,083
Mr. Sharma?

1833
02:04:37,125 --> 02:04:38,000
Mr. Sharma!

1834
02:04:40,666 --> 02:04:42,708
Yes, sir. I failed.

1835
02:04:43,250 --> 02:04:45,041
Why?

1836
02:04:45,458 --> 02:04:48,791
Just say your grandmother passed away
that year.

1837
02:04:49,583 --> 02:04:52,125
That year, they stopped us
from cheating in our exam.

1838
02:04:52,625 --> 02:04:53,291
What?

1839
02:04:55,250 --> 02:04:58,291
Our village had a new Deputy,
Dushyant Singh.

1840
02:04:59,208 --> 02:05:01,833
He stopped us from cheating
and the whole school failed.

1841
02:05:02,916 --> 02:05:04,500
"Stopped us from cheating."

1842
02:05:05,125 --> 02:05:06,666
Is this guy for real?

1843
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:13,500
Anyway... thank you for your time.
You may please leave now.

1844
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:20,875
Didn't you hear me?

1845
02:05:21,416 --> 02:05:22,416
Leave!

1846
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:24,875
Yes, sir.

1847
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:36,166
Manoj, wait outside please.

1848
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:19,166
Manoj, whether you're an IPS officer
or a flour mill worker,

1849
02:06:19,208 --> 02:06:22,375
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1850
02:06:24,166 --> 02:06:27,041
Will you marry me, Manoj?

1851
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:03,000
Sir, you are being called inside.

1852
02:07:13,875 --> 02:07:15,333
Yes, please sit.

1853
02:07:16,875 --> 02:07:18,250
Are you feeling okay?

1854
02:07:25,416 --> 02:07:26,458
I'm feeling good.

1855
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:31,875
So tell me, why tell us about the cheating?
You could've lied instead.

1856
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:36,125
It didn't feel right, ma'am,
to hide cheating by cheating again.

1857
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,916
Then why cheat in the first place?

1858
02:07:38,125 --> 02:07:40,291
I didn't know it was wrong, ma'am.

1859
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,166
-Our teachers helped us to cheat.
-Gosh! But that's wrong!

1860
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:45,500
Yes, ma'am. Very wrong.

1861
02:07:46,666 --> 02:07:48,625
How did you pass the next year?

1862
02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:51,541
-The teachers helped you cheat again?
-Yes, ma'am.

1863
02:07:52,416 --> 02:07:54,625
And everyone cheated.
Except for me.

1864
02:07:55,625 --> 02:07:58,833
Had I cheated, I'd have passed
with a 1st division, like in 10th.

1865
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,125
You turned a new leaf rather quickly.

1866
02:08:01,291 --> 02:08:02,625
Not really, sir.

1867
02:08:03,625 --> 02:08:05,041
Took me almost 19 years.

1868
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:09,916
If I hadn't met Dushyant sir,
I would never have changed.

1869
02:08:10,625 --> 02:08:12,458
Everyone got 1st division, I got 3rd.

1870
02:08:12,541 --> 02:08:14,791
But I was the happiest.

1871
02:08:15,500 --> 02:08:17,041
That day, I realized...

1872
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:21,958
an honest 3rd division is more fulfilling
than a dishonest 1st division.

1873
02:08:22,791 --> 02:08:26,083
Teachers helping cheat?
That's appalling!

1874
02:08:26,291 --> 02:08:31,208
Ma'am, our Principal calls it
'an age-old tradition'.

1875
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,166
And this tradition will go on forever.

1876
02:08:35,250 --> 02:08:36,750
Why do you say that?

1877
02:08:37,666 --> 02:08:40,125
Because ma'am,
no one wants it to change.

1878
02:08:41,125 --> 02:08:44,708
Those in power never want to let it go.

1879
02:08:45,791 --> 02:08:47,750
If the poor remain uneducated,

1880
02:08:48,166 --> 02:08:51,208
only then will the herd
blindly follow the powerful.

1881
02:08:51,291 --> 02:08:53,875
The uneducated
are the most dependable vote bank

1882
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,250
who are easily manipulated
based on caste and religion.

1883
02:08:58,250 --> 02:09:01,833
That's why, in 1942, Dr. Ambedkar said,

1884
02:09:01,833 --> 02:09:04,416
"Educate, Agitate and Organize!"

1885
02:09:05,125 --> 02:09:08,625
If the citizens were educated,
it could be a real problem for leaders.

1886
02:09:13,791 --> 02:09:17,666
Mr. Manoj, I think
you're in the wrong chamber.

1887
02:09:18,625 --> 02:09:22,625
With such provocative statements,
you should aim for a career in politics.

1888
02:09:22,791 --> 02:09:24,000
Sorry, sir.

1889
02:09:24,125 --> 02:09:27,875
Could you explain 'provocative'
in Hindi, please?

1890
02:09:28,875 --> 02:09:30,916
You talk big,

1891
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:33,666
but don't understand simple English.

1892
02:09:33,875 --> 02:09:35,166
I don't think you fit in here.

1893
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:36,166
No, sir. I do fit.

1894
02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:37,541
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

1895
02:09:37,666 --> 02:09:38,375
How?

1896
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:40,125
Because language is just a medium.

1897
02:09:40,416 --> 02:09:42,875
That's just an excuse for you
to cover your weakness.

1898
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:43,666
No, sir.

1899
02:09:43,791 --> 02:09:44,750
Mr. Sharma...

1900
02:09:45,416 --> 02:09:46,416
you've said, you fit.

1901
02:09:46,416 --> 02:09:47,916
Now convince me you fit.

1902
02:09:53,916 --> 02:09:55,625
May I have some water please?

1903
02:09:57,250 --> 02:09:58,375
Go ahead.

1904
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:01,333
No, ma'am, may I have a steel glass?

1905
02:10:01,416 --> 02:10:03,750
I'm not used to these.

1906
02:10:03,875 --> 02:10:05,041
Don't waste our time.

1907
02:10:05,416 --> 02:10:06,750
-Is the water clean?
-Yes, sir.

1908
02:10:06,875 --> 02:10:07,666
So drink it.

1909
02:10:07,666 --> 02:10:10,375
-The glass makes no difference.
-Exactly, sir!

1910
02:10:10,625 --> 02:10:11,833
The water needs to be clean.

1911
02:10:11,875 --> 02:10:14,125
Irrespective of the glass it is in.

1912
02:10:14,125 --> 02:10:17,625
Same way, the officer needs to be clean,
irrespective of the language he speaks.

1913
02:10:17,625 --> 02:10:21,125
That's just clever talk.
We have a lot of IIM and IIT toppers.

1914
02:10:21,166 --> 02:10:22,750
Why should we select a 12th fail?

1915
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:25,041
They may be toppers, sir,

1916
02:10:25,125 --> 02:10:28,250
but they've never seen
what I've experienced.

1917
02:10:28,583 --> 02:10:30,708
They haven't seen cheating
in a village school.

1918
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:33,708
Given the opportunity, I can promise you

1919
02:10:33,750 --> 02:10:36,333
there'll be no cheating
across villages.

1920
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:40,250
No rickshaw wrongly confiscated.
No free run for the corrupt.

1921
02:10:40,375 --> 02:10:41,625
I'll do better than them.

1922
02:10:41,625 --> 02:10:42,916
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

1923
02:10:42,958 --> 02:10:46,250
You really feel a 12th-fail is better
than an IIT topper?

1924
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:49,625
Maybe not better, sir.

1925
02:10:51,125 --> 02:10:52,416
But I am more deserving.

1926
02:10:52,750 --> 02:10:54,041
More worthy.

1927
02:10:54,125 --> 02:10:56,458
How can you say that?
I think you're delusional.

1928
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,375
Sir Edmund Hillary was the first
to summit Everest.

1929
02:11:01,791 --> 02:11:03,750
Everyone has seen his photo.

1930
02:11:06,041 --> 02:11:10,250
But Ang Rita was the first Sherpa
to summit Everest without oxygen support.

1931
02:11:10,625 --> 02:11:12,000
I've seen his photo, sir.

1932
02:11:12,125 --> 02:11:17,291
In my opinion,
his was a bigger achievement.

1933
02:11:18,958 --> 02:11:22,416
I too made it here
without oxygen support, sir.

1934
02:11:23,916 --> 02:11:25,583
Barefoot!

1935
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,375
Mr. Sharma, let me tell you
one last thing.

1936
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,625
If Sir Edmund Hillary had not found the way,

1937
02:11:33,666 --> 02:11:37,166
your Sherpa would've never reached
the peak.

1938
02:11:40,541 --> 02:11:42,416
Anyway, I'm done with you.

1939
02:11:43,041 --> 02:11:44,416
Anyone else?

1940
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:48,666
Which attempt of yours is this?

1941
02:11:49,625 --> 02:11:50,666
Last attempt, ma'am.

1942
02:11:50,750 --> 02:11:52,458
What if you don't get selected?

1943
02:11:56,791 --> 02:11:57,916
I'll accept that.

1944
02:11:59,916 --> 02:12:02,000
But, I won't accept defeat,

1945
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:04,291
I'm not that easy to beat.

1946
02:12:05,375 --> 02:12:07,666
I will not rest
till the goal is reached.

1947
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:12,000
It's your last attempt.
How will you reach it?

1948
02:12:13,291 --> 02:12:16,000
My goal isn't to become an IPS officer.

1949
02:12:16,625 --> 02:12:18,666
The goal is to reform my country.

1950
02:12:19,916 --> 02:12:22,833
If I don't get selected,
I'll become a school teacher

1951
02:12:22,916 --> 02:12:25,291
and teach village kids not to cheat.

1952
02:12:25,625 --> 02:12:28,958
If they learn young,
they'll lead honest, happy lives.

1953
02:12:31,041 --> 02:12:35,291
This thought struck me one day
when the lights went out

1954
02:12:35,416 --> 02:12:37,333
and I was studying under a street lamp.

1955
02:12:38,625 --> 02:12:40,041
That...

1956
02:12:42,250 --> 02:12:45,875
if I cannot be the Sun
that lights up the Earth...

1957
02:12:48,166 --> 02:12:51,000
If I cannot be the Sun
that shines upon the Earth,

1958
02:12:51,416 --> 02:12:53,750
I can still be a lamp
and light up my street.

1959
02:12:55,375 --> 02:12:56,500
Good.

1960
02:12:56,666 --> 02:12:59,291
Be a lamp.
You may go now.

1961
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,083
Thank you, sir.

1962
02:13:03,250 --> 02:13:04,666
Thank you, ma'am.

1963
02:13:04,750 --> 02:13:06,000
Thank you.

1964
02:13:19,458 --> 02:13:21,458
Waste of time.

1965
02:13:21,625 --> 02:13:23,541
Such arrogance!

1966
02:13:25,875 --> 02:13:27,083
A month and a half later...

1967
02:13:27,791 --> 02:13:32,750
Shraddha dragged Manoj
to check his final result.

1968
02:13:34,041 --> 02:13:35,625
He didn't even want to go.

1969
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,750
His "waste of time"
still echoes in my ears.

1970
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,541
I won't pass.

1971
02:13:40,625 --> 02:13:44,750
In that case, we'll work
at the flour mill together. Okay?

1972
02:13:45,125 --> 02:13:46,416
Sir, are the results out?

1973
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:48,000
I don't work for you, lady.

1974
02:13:48,125 --> 02:13:49,375
I don't know.

1975
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,375
Hey, move that damn rickshaw!

1976
02:13:52,666 --> 02:13:53,750
Move!

1977
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,375
No time to mourn
Dreams that are slain

1978
02:14:19,291 --> 02:14:23,833
Tears won't betray
My heart's pain

1979
02:14:26,958 --> 02:14:31,291
No use to woe on,
With a smile I'll go on

1980
02:14:32,791 --> 02:14:35,916
Tell fate I'll return,
Tomorrow is my turn!

1981
02:14:59,041 --> 02:15:01,166
What happened?

1982
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:02,250
Manoj?

1983
02:15:03,291 --> 02:15:05,916
You check. I know I won't make it.

1984
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,541
-Manoj...
-You look, I can't.

1985
02:15:19,041 --> 02:15:21,833
Waste of time.
Such arrogance!

1986
02:15:23,291 --> 02:15:26,750
He's raw. He just needs training.

1987
02:15:27,291 --> 02:15:28,500
What do you think, Miss Qureshi?

1988
02:15:28,625 --> 02:15:31,833
People with noble intentions
are hard to find, Dr. Mehta.

1989
02:15:31,833 --> 02:15:34,208
He'll be good for the image
of the police force.

1990
02:15:34,208 --> 02:15:36,875
What about you, Mr. Yadav?
You've been very quiet.

1991
02:15:40,291 --> 02:15:43,583
The system needs bold, honest people.

1992
02:15:44,625 --> 02:15:48,333
If such candidates don't get selected,
what's the point of this process?

1993
02:16:11,291 --> 02:16:14,791
Broken strings play
A melodious sound

1994
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:19,500
A flower breaks through
The stony ground

1995
02:16:19,625 --> 02:16:23,666
Spring and birdsong
Replace winters gone wrong

1996
02:16:23,916 --> 02:16:31,916
Morning rays bring
A new song to sing

1997
02:16:31,958 --> 02:16:33,083
Breaking news!

1998
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:38,375
A 12th fail, a toilet sweeper,
a flour-mill worker

1999
02:16:38,666 --> 02:16:43,375
and my friend, is an IPS topper,
Manoj Kumar Sharma!

2000
02:16:43,750 --> 02:16:46,791
Pritam Pandey reporting live
on TV for the first time.

2001
02:16:46,916 --> 02:16:49,208
He's done it!

2002
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:52,125
My Manoj has become an IPS officer!

2003
02:16:52,291 --> 02:16:55,416
Aunty, Manoj has become an IPS officer!

2004
02:16:55,625 --> 02:16:59,500
He's become an IPS officer!

2005
02:16:59,750 --> 02:17:03,000
My friend Manoj
has become an IPS officer!

2006
02:17:03,166 --> 02:17:05,166
What are you staring at?

2007
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,041
Hey Manoj!

2008
02:17:09,250 --> 02:17:12,291
You've become an IPS officer?

2009
02:17:12,875 --> 02:17:15,250
Yes, Ma. I have.

2010
02:17:17,666 --> 02:17:21,666
The next time you're home,
you'll come in uniform, won't you?

2011
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:23,666
Yes, Ma.

2012
02:17:29,125 --> 02:17:32,916
-You've done it?
-Yes, Papa. I have.

2013
02:17:33,875 --> 02:17:36,875
-I've got to run.
-Where are you going?

2014
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:39,208
That corrupt Chauhan should know

2015
02:17:39,291 --> 02:17:42,041
he's messing with the father
of an IPS officer!

2016
02:17:43,791 --> 02:17:45,375
Where did he go?

2017
02:17:46,916 --> 02:17:49,500
To tell that corrupt Chauhan

2018
02:17:49,625 --> 02:17:53,083
he's messing with the father
of an IPS officer.

2019
02:18:03,541 --> 02:18:04,875
One from this angle.

2020
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,166
Now take the wide shot.

2021
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,125
Get a close-up.

2022
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:11,500
Smile, please.

2023
02:18:13,250 --> 02:18:14,166
Did you get it?

2024
02:18:14,250 --> 02:18:16,541
Now, go for video.

2025
02:18:16,666 --> 02:18:20,333
Congratulations, Mr. Manoj!

2026
02:18:20,625 --> 02:18:22,750
Congratulations for this, as well.

2027
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,500
Here's 150,000 in cash.

2028
02:18:24,875 --> 02:18:27,500
Just say, you were coached
at A2Z. Okay?

2029
02:18:27,916 --> 02:18:29,250
Camera on.

2030
02:18:29,541 --> 02:18:30,750
Mr. Manoj Kumar Sharma...

2031
02:18:30,875 --> 02:18:34,916
on this momentous day, tell everyone
which coaching class you went to!

2032
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:38,750
I don't think you recognize me, ma'am.

2033
02:18:39,375 --> 02:18:42,000
Three years ago, you asked me
a question.

2034
02:18:42,166 --> 02:18:46,125
Do you think movie stars chew
the same tobacco they sell you?

2035
02:18:47,625 --> 02:18:49,833
-Today, I'll tell you what's wrong with it.
-Stop recording!

2036
02:18:50,250 --> 02:18:51,125
Bloody idiot!

2037
02:18:51,291 --> 02:18:53,250
Where are you going?

2038
02:18:53,791 --> 02:18:56,583
She's vanished.
No one wants to hear you preach.

2039
02:18:56,708 --> 02:18:58,625
So what? Preach again--

2040
02:18:58,791 --> 02:19:00,583
Restart, restart.

2041
02:19:00,666 --> 02:19:02,875
-Restart!
-Restart!

2042
02:19:06,833 --> 02:19:08,750
What's your result?

2043
02:19:14,125 --> 02:19:15,541
IPS.

2044
02:19:15,875 --> 02:19:16,958
Sir!

2045
02:19:20,125 --> 02:19:21,375
Sir!

2046
02:19:23,750 --> 02:19:25,000
Sir!

2047
02:19:25,666 --> 02:19:26,750
Sir!

2048
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:38,791
The first invite for my wedding, sir.

2049
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:41,625
Thank you!

2050
02:19:44,166 --> 02:19:46,708
You don't remember me.

2051
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,625
You had once told me to stop cheating...

2052
02:19:53,625 --> 02:19:56,041
I stopped cheating, sir.

2053
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,583
-The makeshift-rickshaw boy?
-Yes, sir.

2054
02:20:04,125 --> 02:20:05,166
Sir!

2055
02:20:11,541 --> 02:20:14,625
Well done, sir! Well done!

2056
02:20:18,750 --> 02:20:22,083
This is Chambal.

2057
02:20:22,166 --> 02:20:25,250
Yes, that one, notorious for bandits.

2058
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:30,000
And this small village in Chambal
is called Bilgaon.

2059
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:33,750
And the twinkling lights that you see...

2060
02:20:33,875 --> 02:20:36,750
that's Manoj's wedding procession

2061
02:20:37,041 --> 02:20:39,541
on its way to Mussoorie.

2062
02:20:39,833 --> 02:20:44,250
This is a country of the brave and young,
of the passionate and the free.

2063
02:20:44,375 --> 02:20:48,791
What do I tell you
of this wondrous land?

2064
02:20:48,875 --> 02:20:51,000
A jewel of the world!

2065
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:55,625
Now let me introduce you
to a few exclusive guests.

2066
02:20:55,875 --> 02:20:57,500
You recognize that face?

2067
02:20:57,625 --> 02:21:01,125
You got it... our beloved Mayor.

2068
02:21:01,500 --> 02:21:03,875
Here's his notorious crony Chauhan-ji.

2069
02:21:04,125 --> 02:21:06,625
And his vicious lapdog Albel-ji.

2070
02:21:06,875 --> 02:21:07,791
Shall we leave?

2071
02:21:07,875 --> 02:21:10,125
All together in one makeshift rickshaw.

2072
02:21:10,416 --> 02:21:14,375
See, what change
just one honest officer can bring?

2073
02:21:14,875 --> 02:21:15,750
Got it?

2074
02:21:15,875 --> 02:21:20,166
Or do I take you back to zero...
and restart?
