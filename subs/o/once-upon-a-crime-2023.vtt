00:12.095 --> 00:14.097
[whimsical music playing]

00:17.517 --> 00:19.394
[narrator] Once upon a time,

00:19.936 --> 00:22.564
there was a pretty little girl.

00:25.692 --> 00:29.571
Her grandmother loves her very much.

00:30.280 --> 00:36.119
One day, she gave her
a riding hood made of red velvet.

00:38.955 --> 00:41.249
Because it looked so good on her,

00:41.332 --> 00:44.085
she wanted to wear it all the time.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.838
Time passed by…

00:47.338 --> 00:51.551
She came to be known
as Little Red Riding Hood.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.638
[birds chirping]

00:58.141 --> 01:00.143
[adventurous music playing]

01:01.352 --> 01:03.813
[narrator] As the years passed,

01:04.481 --> 01:06.775
Little Red Riding Hood grew up

01:06.858 --> 01:11.488
and became
a very smart, very fine, young woman.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.908
With great hope in her heart,

01:14.991 --> 01:16.701
Little Red Riding Hood

01:16.785 --> 01:19.537
decided to set out on an adventure.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.539
[adventurous music continues]

01:21.623 --> 01:25.543
ONCE UPON A CRIME

01:27.462 --> 01:29.005
[clock-tower bell ringing]

01:33.718 --> 01:35.470
I wonder if there's a town nearby.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.848
-[snapping sound]
-Ouch! Hey! Ow!

01:39.682 --> 01:40.558
Oof!

01:41.059 --> 01:43.311
There are so many thorns everywhere.

01:43.394 --> 01:47.649
This forest is beautiful,
but I've really got to stop doing that.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.235
[woman cackles]

01:51.319 --> 01:55.615
Haven't you ever heard the saying,
"Every rose has its thorn," dear?

01:58.034 --> 02:00.954
[cackles]

02:02.288 --> 02:04.374
Hey! Don't you dare walk away from me!

02:06.209 --> 02:08.837
It's impressive
that you thought you could ignore me,

02:09.420 --> 02:11.339
because I'm a witch, you know.

02:12.423 --> 02:13.716
I said, "A witch!"

02:14.342 --> 02:15.802
Don't you think that's cool?

02:15.885 --> 02:17.137
[ominous music playing]

02:17.220 --> 02:18.429
What can I do for you?

02:18.513 --> 02:21.808
I'm going to Spenhagen.
Maybe you're going that way too.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.436
[laughs]

02:25.520 --> 02:26.855
Spenhagen, huh?

02:26.938 --> 02:30.775
My goodness, that's an awfully long walk
from here. Isn't it now?

02:31.359 --> 02:33.903
Yes, it is. So if you'll excuse me…

02:33.987 --> 02:36.239
In those shabby shoes?

02:36.322 --> 02:40.326
Walking anywhere in those ugly things
is gonna be way too hard.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.494
You won't get far in them.

02:41.578 --> 02:46.499
Listen. Why don't I use my magic
to turn them into a gorgeous pair--

02:46.583 --> 02:50.795
-I'm good. Thank you.
-Hey! Now just wait a second, missy!

02:50.879 --> 02:52.088
[panting]

02:52.172 --> 02:55.758
Look at you! You can't even
outrun me in those ratty, old things!

02:55.842 --> 02:57.677
-Let me help you--
-You're scaring me.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.762
[laughing]

03:00.847 --> 03:02.849
…with my… [panting]

03:02.932 --> 03:04.017
…with my magic!

03:06.561 --> 03:08.146
Maybe you should catch your breath.

03:08.897 --> 03:12.108
-You need new shoes, little girl!
-Ah!

03:12.192 --> 03:13.776
[panting]

03:13.860 --> 03:15.904
-I can give you… [gags]
-[Red Riding Hood] Huh?

03:17.697 --> 03:19.324
-[witch gags]
-[Red Riding Hood] Oh wow.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.911
Um, ma'am, do you maybe need some help?

03:22.994 --> 03:27.540
In this country,
beauty is the only thing that matters.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.835
You see? I'm much more stylish
than your average witch.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.086
Don't you think? Look.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.047
You see that? Style.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.091
You see? Huh? Huh?

03:37.967 --> 03:40.345
I bet you think this staff is ugly, right?

03:40.428 --> 03:41.471
[sighs]

03:41.554 --> 03:42.931
That's 'cause it's an antique!

03:43.556 --> 03:45.183
A kid like you can't appreciate its value.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.685
You young people
don't know what's what these days.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.437
If you say so.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.563
Look,

03:51.064 --> 03:53.107
I'm not trying
to make this all about me.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.444
I just want to replace your shoes
with a new custom-made pair

03:56.527 --> 03:57.779
fit for a queen.

03:58.404 --> 04:01.282
Magical staff, transform
those wretched shoes

04:01.366 --> 04:05.245
and make this plain, young woman
into someone beautiful.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.080
I'm starting
to take this a bit personally.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.708
Vinda Vanda

04:13.086 --> 04:15.672
Vindaly!

04:15.755 --> 04:18.049
[dramatic music playing]

04:18.132 --> 04:20.134
[magical chimes tinkling]

04:23.429 --> 04:24.472
[Red Riding Hood] Ugh.

04:25.348 --> 04:28.935
Ew! Are they supposed to feel so squishy?

04:29.477 --> 04:31.479
[birds chirping]

04:35.400 --> 04:37.777
[groans] Some magic.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.737
That was just rude, if you ask me.

04:39.821 --> 04:43.074
Well, you know, I'm not bad
at most magical spells.

04:43.658 --> 04:49.789
Except for, ugh… except for shoes. Ugh.
Shoes have always been difficult.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.792
[Red Riding Hood] Then why don't you
stick to magic you're good at?

04:52.875 --> 04:56.587
Hey, there, you missed a spot.
Just on the heel. See?

04:56.671 --> 04:57.588
Oh.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.382
And whose fault is that, now?

05:02.427 --> 05:04.304
-[laughs]
-Oh! Oh!

05:04.387 --> 05:05.596
Wait! Ah!

05:05.680 --> 05:07.849
Hey! Ouch! Ugh!

05:07.932 --> 05:09.350
Ugh! Ugh!

05:09.851 --> 05:10.685
Oh.

05:10.768 --> 05:13.146
[witch] Oh well.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.274
There's always a silver lining, you know.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.193
Those were
the slimiest, muddiest boots I ever saw.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.279
[laughs]

05:30.371 --> 05:32.373
[curious music playing]

05:39.547 --> 05:40.506
[sighs]

05:41.841 --> 05:42.884
[groans]

05:52.935 --> 05:55.146
Oh, my boots.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.148
Oh.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.782
Ow! Eee! Ow, ow, ow, ow.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.451
Ah, ouch, ouch, ouch! Ugh!

06:08.534 --> 06:09.535
Sheesh!

06:15.416 --> 06:16.250
Hey.

06:17.835 --> 06:18.669
Those are my boots.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.468
Ah.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.096
I wondered who these belonged to.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.646
[Red Riding Hood] Thank you.

06:52.870 --> 06:56.290
My name's Little Red Riding Hood.
What's your name?

06:58.668 --> 06:59.794
Cinderella.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.713
[emotional music playing]

07:06.050 --> 07:06.968
Oh.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.638
I used to have a pet pigeon.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.724
Unfortunately, it died.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.771
Sorry. That's very sad.

07:24.485 --> 07:28.656
[distorted whirring]

07:34.370 --> 07:36.205
Hey, Cinderella.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.499
Are you being bullied?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.835
-Huh?
-Uh…

07:41.335 --> 07:44.839
I know that we just met,
but I trust my instincts.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.384
Is the person bullying you
your stepmother?

07:48.926 --> 07:51.804
Or maybe it's Anne, your older stepsister?

07:53.473 --> 07:54.807
How did you know that?

07:56.434 --> 08:00.646
Well, those worn-out clothes,
they're hand-me-downs, aren't they?

08:01.647 --> 08:03.441
The name Anne is written at the neck.

08:04.233 --> 08:06.444
The fact that she took the trouble
to write out her name

08:06.527 --> 08:08.654
means there must be
another sister in the house.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.740
You have another sister too, right?

08:14.118 --> 08:17.997
Looks like your stepmom
doesn't wanna give you any new clothing.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.751
And the fact that you're not
complaining about that must mean

08:22.460 --> 08:23.753
you don't wanna fight with her.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.007
And then, there's your name.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.635
My name?

08:31.594 --> 08:34.013
They really call you Cinderella?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.057
Cinders are ashes.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.060
Your name means "covered in ashes."

08:40.561 --> 08:42.730
The fact that even you call yourself that,

08:43.564 --> 08:46.359
well, that must mean that everyone
in your house is bullying you.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.489
You're good.

08:52.990 --> 08:57.328
But that still doesn't explain
why everyone's treating you so horribly.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.333
[crying]

09:02.917 --> 09:03.751
[sniffles]

09:11.217 --> 09:14.512
Crying won't fix anything, you know?

09:25.481 --> 09:26.816
In this country,

09:29.777 --> 09:32.280
the only thing that matters
is being beautiful.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.034
And that's why the king's castle
on the hill

09:37.118 --> 09:39.745
is the most beautiful place
in the whole world.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.082
It's practically a crime
if you're not beautiful.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.961
People who are ugly
or who are poor and dirty…

09:47.044 --> 09:48.629
Stop! Get out of here!

09:48.713 --> 09:51.257
[Cinderella]
…won't ever be taken seriously by anyone.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.971
That's why they make me
wear clothes like this.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.932
[goat bleats]

10:00.641 --> 10:01.601
Cinderella!

10:03.811 --> 10:04.687
Yes, Stepmother.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.607
Does this teacup look right to you?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.443
-Get some more tea right now!
-Of course.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.694
[stepmother] My gosh.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.406
Not only is she ugly,
but she's also lazy and slow.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.491
I'm sorry.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.369
Cinderella, I want the mirror.
I need it immediately.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.662
[Cinderella] Yes.

10:21.746 --> 10:26.375
Cinderella, go get some raspberries.
Looks like I'm running out of jam.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.838
Um, Margot, dear sister,
would you mind if I…

10:31.839 --> 10:33.758
-Huh?
-Uh?

10:34.717 --> 10:35.551
Wait.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.469
What?

10:36.552 --> 10:38.804
[gasps] Oh my gosh, no.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.224
Did you actually think that you'd
be able to come to the ball with us?

10:43.643 --> 10:44.560
Well, I…

10:44.644 --> 10:45.978
[stepmother blows raspberry]

10:46.062 --> 10:47.104
[laughing]

10:47.188 --> 10:49.690
Don't tell me
that's what you were thinking.

10:49.774 --> 10:50.775
There's no way!

10:50.858 --> 10:52.652
[laughing]

10:52.735 --> 10:55.905
Listen, Cinderella.
Tonight's ball is special

10:55.988 --> 10:58.866
because the prince
is going to be choosing his princess.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.493
And it's going to be even more special

11:00.576 --> 11:04.038
because my gorgeous daughter Anne
will surely be picked as princess.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.707
[gasps] Now, stop that, Mother.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.459
[chuckles]

11:08.542 --> 11:10.336
But if the prince were to ever find out

11:10.419 --> 11:13.339
that I have
such an ugly-looking stepsister,

11:14.048 --> 11:16.717
then, I'll only be half as attractive.

11:16.801 --> 11:17.677
Right.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.261
That's no good.

11:19.845 --> 11:20.805
Let's see.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.349
I'll hire the very best hairdresser

11:23.432 --> 11:26.560
to make you even more attractive
than you are now.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.021
[gasps] Oh, that's so nice of you, Mother.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.439
Mmm, I know.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.649
[chuckling]

11:31.732 --> 11:34.235
Wait, I've got an even better idea now.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.988
-How wonderful, Mother. What is it?
-I was thinking of something…

11:38.072 --> 11:40.741
Oh gosh, I dropped my scone. [groans]

11:40.825 --> 11:42.576
No, stop! That's mine!

11:42.660 --> 11:44.453
Let it go! Ugh! Go on!

11:44.537 --> 11:47.331
Make that filthy thing get out of here.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.626
Cinderella's friends
are so greedy and revolting.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.753
Gross little pigeon!

11:52.837 --> 11:56.382
Ugly things shouldn't be allowed
to exist in this country.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.009
[Cinderella gasps]

11:59.510 --> 12:01.137
-[gasps] Margot, please!
-Ah!

12:06.684 --> 12:10.146
[Red Riding Hood] And that's how
your beloved pigeon ended up dead?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.607
I guess I'm just unlucky.

12:14.483 --> 12:18.195
It's been that way
from the first moment I was born,

12:19.780 --> 12:20.698
because

12:21.949 --> 12:22.908
the both of us,

12:23.826 --> 12:25.202
me and my pigeon,

12:26.996 --> 12:28.998
we just aren't beautiful.

12:31.917 --> 12:32.793
Huh.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.090
Even if you could go to the ball,

12:38.174 --> 12:40.593
you've never even spoken
to the prince, have you?

12:41.343 --> 12:44.764
Would you be happy to become
the wife of a complete stranger?

12:49.935 --> 12:50.770
Yeah.

12:51.562 --> 12:52.855
I'd be okay with him.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.774
What? Wait, you like the guy?

12:54.857 --> 12:55.941
I do.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.861
Oh, yes, the prince
is a really great person, you know.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.531
He treats everyone equally,
and it doesn't matter what you look like.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.993
I saw him up close, one time.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.497
But… I was speechless.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.582
And so I just stared at him.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.834
-Oh, and another thing--
-Another thing?

13:13.918 --> 13:16.545
The prince has also been studying politics
since he was young,

13:16.629 --> 13:18.714
and he's kind and handsome.

13:19.590 --> 13:23.427
When he becomes the king of this land,
I know everything will get better.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.556
And if I could marry
somebody as wonderful as he is,

13:28.432 --> 13:31.602
well, I wouldn't ask for
anything more in my life.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.899
All right then, we're going to the ball,
and I'll help you.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.610
-It's impossible.
-Why?

13:41.028 --> 13:42.029
I just…

13:43.572 --> 13:45.491

Uh, please go right up. You're welcome.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.556
Ah.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.309
Hey! Hey! hey! I said no!

26:01.393 --> 26:04.521
You're unattractive, so you need to leave.
Go on!

26:04.604 --> 26:06.606
[ballroom dance music playing]

26:13.863 --> 26:15.865
[ballroom dance music continues]

26:23.123 --> 26:24.708
So gorgeous!

27:18.678 --> 27:20.388
-Red Riding Hood,
-Hmm?

27:20.472 --> 27:22.098
Do I look strange to you?

27:22.182 --> 27:24.142
I feel like everyone is staring at me.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.353
-Sure, they're staring at you.
-What?

27:26.936 --> 27:29.773
You're so beautiful
that people can't stop staring at you.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.441
Well, that can't be true.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.653
[gasps]

27:35.403 --> 27:36.279
Cinderella?

27:36.905 --> 27:39.157
My stepmother and sister Anne.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.747
Those two over there?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.085
-Ha.
-Where's Margot?

27:50.168 --> 27:51.461
Mother, where is she?

27:51.544 --> 27:52.420
Mmm?

27:52.504 --> 27:53.380
[chuckles]

27:53.463 --> 27:55.048
[gasps] I don't see her.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.425
And she left way earlier than we did.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.636
Ugh, not again.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.554
She probably
stopped somewhere for a snack.

28:01.638 --> 28:02.639
Oh.

28:02.722 --> 28:06.101
Mother, tell me,
do you really like my new haircut?

28:06.184 --> 28:07.977
Anne!

28:08.770 --> 28:12.315
I simply adore your new haircut,
because Mr. Hans did it.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.275
And you know, I never would have guessed

28:14.359 --> 28:16.903
that the prince prefers
women with short hair!

28:16.986 --> 28:18.446
[laughs]

28:18.530 --> 28:21.991
Only the royal hairdresser would ever know
such details about the prince.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.493
[sighs]

28:23.993 --> 28:26.871
[chuckles]
I'm so glad you forced yourself to do it.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.332
-Aren't you?
-Of course I am.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.459
-[stepmother] Hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.920
-I'm just not that used to it yet.
-Mm-hmm.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.797
Ah.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.590
Tell me what happened
with you-know-who.

28:41.803 --> 28:42.971
I can't hear anything.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.181
This music is way too loud.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.268
[gasps] What will I do if they see me?

28:48.351 --> 28:49.352
I wouldn't worry.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.730
No one is going
to recognize you like this.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.982
-You look completely different.
-Are you sure?

28:54.065 --> 28:54.941
Mm-hmm.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.278
-[fanfare playing]
-[doors open]

29:10.832 --> 29:15.545
From the Kingdom of Clair de Lune,
King Bovell.

29:15.628 --> 29:17.630
[trumpets playing]

29:21.384 --> 29:26.431
From the Kingdom of Clair de Lune,
Prince Gilbert.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.896
He really knows how to pull off
a red jacket and white pants.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.815
Typical for the prince.
He looks good in anything.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.318
Wearing that would make
most people look like a lion tamer.

29:38.401 --> 29:41.404
Well, he doesn't.
The prince doesn't look like a lion tamer.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.906
My loyal subjects,

29:44.282 --> 29:48.787
welcome to our beautiful castle
and to tonight's celebration.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.122
This ball serves a dual function.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.334
We will not only enjoy ourselves tonight,

29:54.417 --> 29:58.797
but the prince will also select
a beautiful princess to wed.

29:59.380 --> 30:03.092
If any of you beautiful maidens
are approached by the prince,

30:03.760 --> 30:06.387
you mustn't hesitate to dance with him.

30:07.013 --> 30:08.681
[overlapping chatter]

30:14.521 --> 30:18.233
Now dear prince,
I'd like you to choose your partner.

30:20.693 --> 30:23.071
-Please, Father, will you try to--
-Choose, son.

30:23.613 --> 30:26.783
Forget about that selfish woman
who just disappeared.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.286
Yes, Your Majesty.

30:35.124 --> 30:36.960
Oh, he looked at me. Will I be okay?

30:37.043 --> 30:38.878
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.840
Ah. Ah. Oh, I'm just… I'm so nervous.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.884
Ah! Ah! Ah! I'm…

30:44.968 --> 30:48.054
[muttering]

30:48.137 --> 30:49.389
[stepmother laughs]

30:49.472 --> 30:55.436
I'm… pleased to… meet you, Your Majesty.

30:56.312 --> 30:57.313
[whirring]

30:59.023 --> 30:59.983
[gasps]

31:15.164 --> 31:16.833
Would you like to dance with me?

31:19.836 --> 31:20.879
[chuckles]

31:22.797 --> 31:24.090
Of course.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.175
[guests murmuring]

31:27.260 --> 31:28.928
You go, girl.

31:30.763 --> 31:32.765
[magical music playing]

31:50.491 --> 31:52.493
[ballroom dance music playing]

32:56.349 --> 32:57.183
Thank you.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.019
Huh? For what?

33:00.937 --> 33:03.356
You're beautiful, and I appreciate it.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.527
No, I'm really not.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.907
It's almost time to move on.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.509
Hmm?

33:37.223 --> 33:38.474
Glass slippers?

33:39.350 --> 33:41.644
It looks like
Tekla's been practicing quite a lot.

33:41.728 --> 33:45.398
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!
Your Majesty! Excuse me!

33:45.481 --> 33:47.400
What is the meaning of this commotion?

33:47.483 --> 33:48.943
[man] Forgive me, Your Majesty.

33:50.403 --> 33:51.279
Thank you for that.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.490
Attention, everyone!

33:55.283 --> 33:56.367
I'm sorry,

33:57.368 --> 33:58.786
but I must end the ball.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.872
[guests murmuring]

34:01.998 --> 34:03.750
In the woods, earlier this evening,

34:04.500 --> 34:05.918
a body was discovered.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.921
It is the corpse of Mr. Hans,
my loyal hairdresser.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.007
[suspenseful music playing]

34:13.468 --> 34:15.970
[Bovell] The body was covered up
with leaves and dirt,

34:16.054 --> 34:19.932
which means that someone
deliberately tried to hide the evidence.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.602
There was a hoof-mark on his forehead.

34:22.685 --> 34:26.522
There was also a mark on the back
of his neck, where something struck him.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.650
We think he was hit by a carriage
on his way to the castle

34:29.734 --> 34:33.362
and that he must have died by hitting
his head on a rock on the ground,

34:33.446 --> 34:37.492
which means his killer
is somewhere here among us.

34:37.575 --> 34:38.701
[guests murmuring]

34:38.785 --> 34:41.913
[Bovell] Hans had the unparalleled gift
of making people in this country

34:41.996 --> 34:43.706
look absolutely beautiful.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.667
He was a treasure,
and this crime cannot go unpunished.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.795
The investigation will begin now.

34:49.295 --> 34:52.965
Firstly, every single carriage
that came to the ball will be examined.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.219
If we find blood on one of the carriages,

34:56.302 --> 34:58.387
then we'll know who the murderer is.

35:02.308 --> 35:05.478
No one leaves the castle
until every carriage has been searched.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.981
Lord Chamberlain,
make sure the murderer is found.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.108
Yes, Your Highness.

35:21.786 --> 35:22.912
What do we do?

35:22.995 --> 35:25.289
We've got to do something.
Otherwise, we'll be caught.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.209
Don't worry about it.
Paul is taking care of the carriage.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.293
What?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.462
Huh? Paul's over there!

35:32.380 --> 35:33.840
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, nope.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.258
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

35:35.341 --> 35:38.845
Oh, uh, hello, ladies.
What can I do for you?

35:38.928 --> 35:41.305
Paul, you know the thing
I asked you to do before?

35:41.389 --> 35:43.474
Before?
Oh, the blood on the carriage thing?

35:43.558 --> 35:45.059
Yes, I made sure it was all washed off.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.310
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

35:46.394 --> 35:47.270
Oh, don't you worry.

35:47.353 --> 35:49.939
None of the soldiers
noticed anything out of the ordinary.

35:50.022 --> 35:51.774
And I'm a very meticulous cleaner.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.402
Aw, you're
such a wonderful little mousey!

35:54.485 --> 35:55.444
[chuckles]

35:55.528 --> 35:56.571
Great work, Paul.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.114
Did the guards just let you in?

35:58.197 --> 35:59.866
Ah, here's the thing.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.243
Under the castle,
there are secret passageways

36:02.326 --> 36:04.245
that only mice know about.

36:04.328 --> 36:07.915
The castle has an excellent collection
of wine and special cheeses.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.333
So, because we're mice,

36:09.417 --> 36:11.627
we always use the secret passages.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.337
anytime we want to have a feast.

36:13.963 --> 36:17.925
It's just so irresistible,
the cheese, the wine.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.720
Cheese, wine, cheese… What?

36:20.803 --> 36:22.805
No! I haven't had any wine,

36:22.889 --> 36:24.640
because I still have
to drive the carriage.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.018
It's not a good idea
to run someone over and start drinking.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.770
-Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh!
-Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh! Sh?

36:29.854 --> 36:30.688
-Stop.
-Stop?

36:30.771 --> 36:32.315
-Stop. Stop. Stop. Don't--
-Right.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.734
-Don't talk about running someone down.
-Huh?

36:34.817 --> 36:37.361
-It's a pretty hot topic right now.
-[gasps]

36:37.445 --> 36:38.279
[gasps]

36:39.572 --> 36:40.448
[gasps]

36:42.325 --> 36:44.827
Ah, okay. I don't think they heard me.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.413
Sorry. I will just stick to cheese today.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.957
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Cinderella gasps]

36:50.041 --> 36:52.376
[Chamberlain] Your Majesty,
I've just been informed

36:52.460 --> 36:55.379
that pieces of cheese were found
around Mr. Hans's body.

36:55.463 --> 36:59.133
So our killer was eating cheese
when they killed Mr. Hans,

36:59.217 --> 37:04.138
which means that our culprit
must be mad for cheese.

37:05.097 --> 37:07.808
Search for all the cheese lovers
in the land.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.393
[Chamberlain] Yes, Your Majesty.

37:13.522 --> 37:14.440
It wasn't me.

37:14.523 --> 37:16.901
And anyway,
I only started eating this cheese here,

37:16.984 --> 37:18.069
once I got to the castle.

37:19.612 --> 37:23.699
I think we should leave.
We can escape using the passages.

37:23.783 --> 37:27.954
Cinderella, if we go right now,
then everyone here is going to suspect us.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.998
What if they start chasing us
and catch us?

37:31.082 --> 37:32.333
You're right.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.377
I'm gonna scurry
through the underground passage

37:34.460 --> 37:36.087
and make sure the carriage is okay.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.133
No! No more wine!

37:41.842 --> 37:43.094
Oh, yeah, sure.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.890
[man] This one's clean.
You can release it.

37:48.933 --> 37:52.228
-[man 2] It's a very unusual carriage.
-There's no blood on it.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.315
[clock-tower bell rings]

38:00.069 --> 38:02.071
[clock-tower bell rings]

38:04.949 --> 38:07.910
[clock-tower bell rings]

38:10.079 --> 38:13.374
Eleven o'clock.
The magic is going to wear off in an hour.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.877
If we don't do something,
our spell will break in front of everyone.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.504
Let's wait until the last minute,

38:18.587 --> 38:20.298
and then we'll sneak out
through the passage.

38:24.343 --> 38:25.845
Reporting back, Your Highness.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.264
We examined every single carriage,

38:28.347 --> 38:30.725
but we found no trace of blood
on any of them.

38:32.351 --> 38:36.856
Hmm. So then, that means the killer
isn't here among the guests after all.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.108
No.

38:39.650 --> 38:43.154
What's more,
the doctor examined Mr. Hans's body

38:43.237 --> 38:46.449
and concluded from the blood clotting
that the wound on the back of his head

38:46.532 --> 38:48.993
had been inflicted earlier
than the wound on his forehead.

38:49.076 --> 38:54.957
Which means that Hans must already have
been dead before the carriage hit him.

38:55.708 --> 38:57.251
[mysterious music playing]

39:04.133 --> 39:04.967
[man] Look!

39:08.429 --> 39:11.390
[Chamberlain] The soldiers
who investigated Mr. Hans's house

39:12.099 --> 39:14.226
found a whetstone with blood on it.

39:15.561 --> 39:18.689
We're certain
that the murder occurred at his house.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.275
His presumed time of death

39:21.359 --> 39:24.236
is sometime between
one and three o'clock this afternoon.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.113
Hmm.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.158
Does that mean…
mean that the carriage was a…

39:29.241 --> 39:31.160
Yes, we think it was a tactic.

39:31.243 --> 39:33.537
A ruse to confuse any investigation.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.290
That's exactly what I expected.

39:36.791 --> 39:37.666
Mmm.

39:37.750 --> 39:41.087
The soldiers found some strange things
when they searched Mr. Hans's house.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.296
Things like what?

39:42.380 --> 39:43.381
Bring them in!

39:43.881 --> 39:44.882
[man] Sir!

39:58.020 --> 39:59.105
[Bovell] A lock of hair?

39:59.688 --> 40:02.817
Hmm. Are there
many more locks of hair in that bag?

40:03.401 --> 40:04.819
Yes, your Highness, there are.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.947
And apparently, this is only
a very small sample of them.

40:09.657 --> 40:13.536
Your Majesty, may I offer you
a theory I've come up with?

40:14.286 --> 40:16.872
-Proceed with it.
-Very well. [clears throat]

40:18.082 --> 40:20.418
The despicable killer is here among us!

40:20.501 --> 40:22.628
Isn't that exactly what I said before?

40:22.711 --> 40:24.422
Remember? I said that.

40:24.505 --> 40:27.049
Little Red,
that's my sister Anne's ribbon.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.052
So that hair belongs to…

40:30.136 --> 40:33.556
[Cinderella] Yes, Anne was always proud
of her long, beautiful hair.

40:34.056 --> 40:38.644
And why was this beautiful lock of hair
cut off of its owner?

40:38.727 --> 40:42.731
Because sometimes even the best among us
are still fallible humans.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.024
In other words,

40:44.108 --> 40:46.110
Hans sometimes made mistakes too.

40:48.821 --> 40:53.409
This is all hair that Hans cut off
by accident during some of his sessions.

40:53.492 --> 40:54.869
And if that's the case,

40:54.952 --> 40:58.789
all of these women who had
their long hair cut off accidentally

40:59.415 --> 41:01.834
must've resented Mr. Hans quite a lot.

41:02.543 --> 41:03.586
[Bovell] Hmm?

41:03.669 --> 41:06.839
So then, you mean to say that

41:07.590 --> 41:09.341
a woman with short hair is the killer?

41:10.301 --> 41:11.469
Exactly, Your Highness!

41:11.552 --> 41:13.554
[guests murmuring]

41:17.057 --> 41:19.059
[suspenseful music playing]

41:32.072 --> 41:32.948
You five.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.701
Now, let me ask you.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.746
Do any of these locks belong to you?

41:41.415 --> 41:43.083
It seems a bit strange.

41:43.167 --> 41:46.045
Yes, I see. That's right.
Just as I thought.

41:46.128 --> 41:49.298
Hans accidentally cut off
each one of your ponytails.

41:49.381 --> 41:50.216
So… wait.

41:50.883 --> 41:52.551
Have we found the killer yet?

41:53.427 --> 41:55.262
Well, the killer

41:55.846 --> 41:57.640
is among these five.

41:57.723 --> 42:00.059
[indistinct whispering]

42:00.142 --> 42:02.019
[Red Riding Hood]
Can I say something, please?

42:03.479 --> 42:04.480
Hmm?

42:04.563 --> 42:06.023
I've never seen you around here.

42:06.106 --> 42:08.359
They call me Little Red Riding Hood.

42:09.109 --> 42:11.153
But I'm just a traveler, Your Majesty.

42:11.237 --> 42:15.574
Is that so? Well, then,
"just a traveler," what's up?

42:16.700 --> 42:18.577
I'm very sorry to say this,

42:19.078 --> 42:21.288
but Lord Chamberlain's theory
is incorrect, I'm afraid.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.873
Wh… What?!

42:22.957 --> 42:25.209
[scoffs] Well,
that's very disrespectful, traveler!

42:25.292 --> 42:26.877
Just, calm down, man.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.673
Why do you say that?
His theory made some sense to me.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.009
It's quite simple.

42:34.510 --> 42:37.054
There's something
very strange about this hair.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.055
[Bovell] Hmm?

42:39.098 --> 42:42.226
All of these locks of hair
have pretty ribbons on them.

42:43.310 --> 42:44.687
[Bovell] What's odd about that?

42:45.271 --> 42:46.397
I'll tell you.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.733
I think most people remove their ribbons
before a haircut, right?

42:51.735 --> 42:53.028
Ah!

42:53.112 --> 42:56.949
So this hair wasn't cut off
accidentally at all.

42:57.449 --> 42:59.868
It must've been cut off
when the women were already dressed up.

43:00.452 --> 43:01.287
That's right.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.622
But then, why did Hans do this?

43:04.415 --> 43:05.666
Well,

43:05.749 --> 43:08.502
only the person whose hair
was cut off can answer that.

43:09.503 --> 43:13.382
Can you please give us some details
on your haircut, Miss Anne,

43:13.465 --> 43:14.300
if you don't mind?

43:20.806 --> 43:22.558
Around ten o'clock this morning,

43:23.559 --> 43:27.396
I made my way to Mr. Hans's place
to have my hair done.

43:28.272 --> 43:31.358
It was my dream to have my hair done
by the famous Mr. Hans.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.485
He was the royal hairdresser, after all,

43:33.569 --> 43:35.529
so I was very excited to have it done.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.201
[Hans] Just trust me.

43:42.745 --> 43:48.584
The prince simply loves
women with short hair.

43:49.376 --> 43:53.297
So I'll make sure that you're
exactly the prince's type, huh?

43:53.797 --> 43:55.799
[laughing]

44:00.429 --> 44:01.555
So

44:02.931 --> 44:06.935
I knew my mother had pulled
a lot of strings to make it happen for me

44:07.603 --> 44:09.938
and that it also cost a lot of money,

44:10.022 --> 44:12.107
which made me think carefully.

44:12.191 --> 44:13.108
But…

44:13.734 --> 44:14.610
but I couldn't.

44:15.277 --> 44:18.030
I just couldn't bear cutting off my hair.

44:18.113 --> 44:19.990
Do you want to be a princess

44:20.074 --> 44:23.202
or do you just want to be
a beautiful woman

44:23.285 --> 44:24.870
who has long hair?

44:24.953 --> 44:27.498
You're going to have
to make a decision, you know.

44:27.581 --> 44:29.416
[Anne] Mr. Hans became very intense.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.501
-[gasps]
-[Hans grunts]

44:30.584 --> 44:32.920
And then he suddenly
just cut my hair right off.

44:33.671 --> 44:34.797
[sighs]

44:34.880 --> 44:37.841
[stepmother] Oh!

44:38.425 --> 44:42.012
Oh, my poor sweet Anne. Oh.

44:42.096 --> 44:46.642
Your Highness, so it is true that you
prefer women with shorter hair, right?

44:47.768 --> 44:48.644
[chuckles]

44:48.727 --> 44:52.022
Only you will be able to comfort
my poor, sweet daughter

44:52.106 --> 44:54.108
who has lost her… [sighs]

44:54.191 --> 44:55.859
…her long, gorgeous hair.
Isn't that right?

44:56.860 --> 45:00.864
My daughter is the kind of girl
who would do anything for her prince.

45:00.948 --> 45:05.703
Your Highness, to wed as your princess,
how about my daughter Anne, hmm?

45:05.786 --> 45:06.620
[chuckles]

45:06.704 --> 45:10.082
I believe Anne would be
the best choice for you. Yes?

45:10.165 --> 45:12.626
Your Royal Highness,
I also cut my hair short

45:12.710 --> 45:15.879
because Mr. Hans told me
you liked women with short hair.

45:15.963 --> 45:18.006
Your Royal Highness,
if you like short hair,

45:18.090 --> 45:19.258
I think you should look at me!

45:19.341 --> 45:22.428
-No, my hair is much nicer!
-Anne's hair is the nicest.

45:22.511 --> 45:25.055
-[girl] Old people don't know what's in!
-You!

45:25.139 --> 45:27.850
Your Royal Highness, since you
like women with short hair, look at me!

45:27.933 --> 45:29.977
Shut up, all you babbling idiots!

45:30.060 --> 45:34.732
Now, Anne is the only person in this room
who can pull off having short hair,

45:34.815 --> 45:36.567
unlike any of you.

45:36.650 --> 45:38.610
[overlapping arguing]

45:39.570 --> 45:44.992
Son, is it true that you only like
women with short hair?

45:45.617 --> 45:46.702
That's news to me, you know.

45:50.372 --> 45:51.373
Well, Father…

45:53.876 --> 45:55.335
I've heard things about Hans.

45:55.836 --> 45:58.005
Unsavory rumors
were floating around about him.

45:58.088 --> 46:01.759
You ignored my question about short hair!

46:02.509 --> 46:04.052
What do you mean unsavory rumors?

46:04.636 --> 46:07.556
That man was a most excellent hairdresser.

46:07.639 --> 46:08.599
However,

46:09.099 --> 46:10.934
apparently, he envied women

46:11.018 --> 46:13.270
who weren't his customers
but had beautiful hair.

46:14.229 --> 46:15.481
Why did he envy them?

46:16.440 --> 46:21.570
It would seem he simply couldn't accept
the existence of long, beautiful hair

46:21.653 --> 46:23.322
that he didn't style himself.

46:25.115 --> 46:27.075
And whenever
he would come across a woman

46:27.159 --> 46:28.744
with very beautiful, long hair,

46:29.244 --> 46:31.163
I heard that he would cut it all off

46:31.955 --> 46:33.582
forcefully, against their will.

46:35.083 --> 46:36.835
That is so bizarre.

46:37.336 --> 46:39.004
If that's true…

46:40.714 --> 46:42.925
Do you know what it means,
Detective Riding Hood?

46:45.177 --> 46:46.386
[Anne] Uh, well,

46:47.095 --> 46:48.680
I accidentally overheard something.

46:48.764 --> 46:49.681
[Bovell] Mm-hmm?

46:51.350 --> 46:56.271
Coincidentally, one of my mother's cousins
works as a maid here at the castle.

46:57.022 --> 47:01.276
And so today, she was able to sneak us
into the castle a little after noon.

47:01.860 --> 47:04.196
You snuck into the castle?
What were you two scheming?

47:04.279 --> 47:06.281
Oh, we weren't scheming at all!

47:06.365 --> 47:08.575
All I wanted was… was to meet the prince

47:08.659 --> 47:11.245
and just ask him to invite
me to dance with him later.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.416
So, Your Highness,
did you see Anne and her mother?

47:18.043 --> 47:22.005
No. I'm quite certain this is the very
first time that I've ever met her.

47:22.089 --> 47:24.883
-[Anne] Uh…
-Would you care to elaborate?

47:25.634 --> 47:28.428
I only got as far as his room
and just outside the door.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.222
But I…

47:31.431 --> 47:34.309
I wasn't able to…
to go inside and see him.

47:35.018 --> 47:35.853
Why was that?

47:37.312 --> 47:38.146
Because I…

47:39.898 --> 47:40.732
I…

47:42.317 --> 47:43.819
overheard something.

47:43.902 --> 47:45.904
[humming]

47:49.700 --> 47:51.451
Ah. [clears throat]

47:51.535 --> 47:52.536
Ma, ma. Mmm.

47:52.619 --> 47:54.371
Hmm. Ma. Ma. Hmm.

47:54.454 --> 47:55.497
Mah, mah.

47:56.540 --> 47:59.418
-May I come in?
-[Gilbert] I'll never forgive you, Hans!

47:59.501 --> 48:03.130
[Hans] Now, now, do calm down,
Your Highness.

48:03.630 --> 48:06.550
[Gilbert] Do you even understand
what you've done?

48:07.384 --> 48:08.844
[ominous music playing]

48:08.927 --> 48:10.345
Oh, my…

48:10.429 --> 48:11.680
Oh, but…

48:11.763 --> 48:13.515
Um, um… uh, um…

48:17.603 --> 48:19.146
I can't believe it.

48:20.981 --> 48:24.109
The two of them seemed to be arguing.

48:24.902 --> 48:25.819
The prince,

48:26.695 --> 48:29.448
well, he sounded particularly angry.

48:32.784 --> 48:35.704
So, Your Highness,
is Anne telling us the truth or not?

48:39.666 --> 48:40.500
Yes, she's right.

48:41.752 --> 48:44.713
W… w… wait a second now.
What does this all mean?

48:44.796 --> 48:48.592
My brain is getting all scrambly…
scrambled… scramb…

48:50.719 --> 48:53.096
Just past noon today, Hans showed up

48:53.889 --> 48:55.641
and demanded to see me in my room.

48:58.685 --> 49:00.395
[Hans] I see you've got a new outfit.

49:00.979 --> 49:02.481
That's going to look great on you.

49:02.981 --> 49:05.275
Oops! I'm so very sorry.

49:06.693 --> 49:08.695
[mysterious music playing]

49:13.909 --> 49:14.743
Hans,

49:15.661 --> 49:17.955
where did you…
where did you get this hair?

49:19.164 --> 49:20.040
[chuckles]

49:20.123 --> 49:22.542
That's none of your concern, Your Majesty.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.337
I knew those rumors were real.

49:26.463 --> 49:27.881
I'll never forgive you, Hans!

49:27.965 --> 49:31.802
[Hans] Now, now,
do calm down, Your Highness.

49:32.511 --> 49:33.553
I won't!

49:33.637 --> 49:36.098
Do you even understand what you've done?

49:38.392 --> 49:39.351
[sighs]

49:40.978 --> 49:43.939
I could say the same thing about you!

49:44.731 --> 49:45.732
What?

49:45.816 --> 49:48.777
I know that you have
some secrets of your own.

49:48.860 --> 49:50.278
I was a witness.

49:50.988 --> 49:53.949
I think it was maybe a year ago.

50:02.582 --> 50:04.960
Hans blackmailed you this whole time?

50:07.587 --> 50:08.422
[Gilbert] Yes.

50:15.470 --> 50:16.722
Father, I apologize.

50:19.224 --> 50:20.350
I'll confess.

50:21.268 --> 50:23.812
Last year, when they found
your crown in the trash,

50:26.273 --> 50:27.441
I'm the one who did it.

50:33.488 --> 50:34.698
[sighs]

50:36.408 --> 50:38.952
You're the one who threw
my crown in the trash?

50:40.871 --> 50:43.415
That's a pretty big crime, you know.

50:44.207 --> 50:45.125
Yeah.

50:47.419 --> 50:48.587
[Bovell] Son,

50:49.629 --> 50:51.673
why would you do that?

50:55.594 --> 50:56.428
Was it…

50:58.513 --> 51:01.266
Yes, it's exactly what you thought.

51:01.850 --> 51:02.684
[sighs]

51:02.768 --> 51:06.730
I thought I made myself very clear
about you and that servant girl.

51:06.813 --> 51:09.941
I told you that I would find you
someone even more pretty.

51:10.025 --> 51:12.736
That was the whole reason
that I threw you this ball.

51:12.819 --> 51:13.987
I know that.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.614
But I was so angry with you.

51:16.364 --> 51:18.283
I couldn't get over the fact that you…

51:18.366 --> 51:20.952
you tried to stand in the way
of my great love with her.

51:23.497 --> 51:25.082
[birds chirping]

51:25.165 --> 51:27.209
[tranquil music playing]

51:34.216 --> 51:35.133
Remi.

51:42.349 --> 51:43.642
[chimes tinkle]

51:45.310 --> 51:47.062
[sighs] I can't do this.

51:48.772 --> 51:50.315
I'm sorry, Your Highness,

51:50.398 --> 51:53.235
but I'm not beautiful enough
to be with someone like you.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.822
But you don't need
to worry about that, Remi.

51:56.905 --> 51:59.157
I know you're worried
about being a servant,

51:59.241 --> 52:00.659
but I'm going to convince my father.

52:02.369 --> 52:03.620
Are you sure about this?

52:07.332 --> 52:08.250
Remi…

52:14.464 --> 52:15.465
I'm telling you

52:16.842 --> 52:18.385
you're more beautiful

52:20.262 --> 52:21.721
than anyone in the world.

52:25.433 --> 52:29.729
But then, shortly after I spoke
to the king about her,

52:30.480 --> 52:32.023
Remi suddenly disappeared.

52:33.984 --> 52:37.154
And I think Remi disappeared because…
because you didn't approve of her!

52:37.237 --> 52:39.447
I already told you
I didn't disapprove of her!

52:40.448 --> 52:41.449
[sighs]

52:42.909 --> 52:45.203
It was a misunderstanding between us, son.

52:45.996 --> 52:49.040
Remi decided to run away,
and I had nothing to do with it.

52:49.124 --> 52:51.126
[emotional music playing]

52:52.544 --> 52:53.962
[Chamberlain] Your Highness.

52:54.880 --> 52:56.089
[grunts]

52:56.173 --> 52:59.009
You'll never understand my feelings.
Never!

52:59.676 --> 53:03.221
You'll never know
just how much I loved her, Father!

53:04.306 --> 53:05.182
[sighs]

53:05.682 --> 53:07.100
[Red Riding Hood] Pardon me.

53:08.560 --> 53:09.686
Mind if I interrupt?

53:09.769 --> 53:12.022
You know, your timing
is always a little bit off.

53:12.105 --> 53:16.067
The way you butt in sometimes,
well, it makes things a bit hard.

53:16.151 --> 53:17.736
Anyone ever explain timing to you?

53:18.987 --> 53:22.741
I just wanted to move the story along.
Your Highness, is that okay with you?

53:24.201 --> 53:25.076
[sighs]

53:26.203 --> 53:29.122
So after that,
did Mr. Hans leave straightaway?

53:30.749 --> 53:32.751
[mysterious music playing]

53:34.294 --> 53:36.296
[Hans] Without a crown
to place on the king's head,

53:36.379 --> 53:39.674
it was quite a challenge for me
to make him look good.

53:39.758 --> 53:45.263
It's a bit hard to make a king
look dignified when he has no crown!

53:45.347 --> 53:46.431
[chuckles]

53:46.514 --> 53:50.352
But it wasn't a problem
once I figured out what you had done.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.780
You know what I'd love?

54:02.948 --> 54:06.201
If you gave me
your lovely handheld mirror as a gift.

54:08.328 --> 54:12.666
You can deliver it to my house later
to make up for what you've done.

54:12.749 --> 54:16.670
Why don't we say
around five o'clock this evening?

54:19.965 --> 54:21.383
[Gilbert] I had no choice.

54:23.718 --> 54:25.679
The royal mirror was
the only thing he'd accept.

54:27.931 --> 54:32.352
Don't tell me that you gave Mr. Hans
a royal-family heirloom?

54:36.481 --> 54:37.816
[knock on door]

54:38.733 --> 54:39.943
[man] I beg your pardon.

54:40.026 --> 54:43.780
Your Highness, I've come
to pick up the item for Mr. Hans.

54:46.408 --> 54:47.325
[sighs]

54:50.036 --> 54:50.996
[sighs]

54:56.835 --> 55:00.130
[Gilbert] In the end, I couldn't
bring myself to have it delivered to him.

55:03.216 --> 55:06.052
I looked at my reflection
and I realized something.

55:07.637 --> 55:09.889
Even though I'd heard
the rumors about Hans,

55:10.473 --> 55:13.810
I'd almost succumbed to his threats
and hadn't tried to stop him.

55:13.893 --> 55:15.770
And that made me feel ashamed.

55:17.230 --> 55:18.231
My son,

55:19.357 --> 55:23.028
please don't tell me that,
in order to keep this blackmail a secret,

55:23.111 --> 55:25.071
you murdered Mr. Hans instead.

55:26.323 --> 55:27.866
No, of course not, Father.

55:28.950 --> 55:31.077
I swear I didn't kill him.

55:31.161 --> 55:33.038
Tonight, after this ball was over,

55:33.121 --> 55:36.082
I was going to confess
that I threw away your crown.

55:37.667 --> 55:39.127
Unfortunately, my son,

55:40.003 --> 55:43.423
there isn't anyone…
who can help you prove that.

55:43.506 --> 55:46.217
I didn't do it. You have to believe that.

55:46.301 --> 55:48.261
[Bovell] You've got
to explain several things.

55:49.554 --> 55:52.390
For example, why you weren't
at the dance rehearsal.

55:53.183 --> 55:55.435
I wanted to see
how your waltz was progressing.

55:56.269 --> 55:57.979
But you weren't in your room.

55:58.063 --> 56:00.190
Then I looked for you all over the castle.

56:02.650 --> 56:03.651
I wanted…

56:05.028 --> 56:06.571
Well, I just wanted to be alone,

56:07.197 --> 56:08.907
so I went out for a walk by myself.

56:10.533 --> 56:12.744
That sounds like a convenient excuse, son.

56:14.120 --> 56:17.332
Prince Gilbert, around what time
did you go for your walk?

56:19.501 --> 56:20.919
From one o'clock to three o'clock.

56:21.836 --> 56:23.421
[gasps] Detective Riding Hood,

56:23.505 --> 56:27.258
that's the same time that the doctor
believes Mr. Hans was killed.

56:27.342 --> 56:29.135
No, that's just a coincidence.

56:30.595 --> 56:33.890
Prince Gilbert,
did you see anyone during your walk?

56:33.973 --> 56:35.433
No, no one.

56:35.934 --> 56:38.853
I always walk to a hill
where nobody is around.

56:40.271 --> 56:42.399
Which means the prince has

56:42.482 --> 56:46.403
a motive to commit murder,
and no… alibi, right?

56:49.697 --> 56:50.907
[sighs]

56:50.990 --> 56:52.409
[Bovell] My son,

56:52.492 --> 56:56.788
your sense of justice has been strong
since you were a child.

56:58.957 --> 57:02.043
Did your strong sense of justice

57:03.044 --> 57:04.796
work against you this time around?

57:07.257 --> 57:08.633
Of course not.

57:10.301 --> 57:11.261
Father, you're not

57:11.928 --> 57:14.097
accusing me of murdering him, are you?

57:15.348 --> 57:18.643
It wasn't me.
I wasn't the one that killed Mr. Hans!

57:18.726 --> 57:20.270
[breathes deeply]

57:22.439 --> 57:24.065
Would you seize the prince?

57:24.149 --> 57:25.817
[sighs] No, Father!

57:27.735 --> 57:29.737
[guest murmuring]

57:40.165 --> 57:41.416
Take him away.

57:45.086 --> 57:47.630
Your Highness,
I believe you're telling the truth.

57:47.714 --> 57:50.300
I know that you
couldn't possibly have killed Mr. Hans.

57:54.471 --> 57:55.513
Thank you.

57:56.639 --> 57:57.557
Prince Gilbert…

58:08.026 --> 58:11.362
Red Riding Hood, there's no way
the prince could have killed him.

58:11.446 --> 58:12.697
Please, do something.

58:12.780 --> 58:15.658
I want to,
but there's circumstantial evidence.

58:16.201 --> 58:17.076
[sighs]

58:20.163 --> 58:21.039
What's that?

58:26.461 --> 58:27.837
Looks like a…

58:27.921 --> 58:28.755
[Cinderella] A thorn?

58:31.090 --> 58:32.759
[guests clamoring]

58:32.842 --> 58:34.636
[man] What is she doing here?

58:35.929 --> 58:38.264
The prince couldn't have killed anyone.

58:38.348 --> 58:40.725
Hey! You don't have permission to be here!

58:40.808 --> 58:42.101
Get out right now!

58:42.810 --> 58:44.187
Please wait a minute!

58:51.736 --> 58:52.987
[sighs]

58:58.910 --> 59:02.705
Just now you said that the prince couldn't
have killed anyone, is that right?

59:03.581 --> 59:04.415
Yes.

59:05.458 --> 59:06.709
Why did you say that?

59:08.127 --> 59:10.046
Earlier this afternoon,

59:10.547 --> 59:12.632
the prince was sitting on a hilltop

59:12.715 --> 59:14.926
between the hours
of one o'clock and three o'clock.

59:16.886 --> 59:17.971
Is that so?

59:18.972 --> 59:22.058
In the woods,
there's a little cave that I sleep in.

59:22.642 --> 59:25.103
And that's where I was
when I saw the prince.

59:25.812 --> 59:26.688
Are you sure?

59:27.438 --> 59:28.356
Yes.

59:29.440 --> 59:31.568
His red jacket and white pants

59:32.235 --> 59:34.487
looked beautiful against the green hill.

59:36.072 --> 59:38.074
If that's the truth, mystery woman,

59:38.157 --> 59:41.119
then the prince would have
a… a solid alibi.

59:41.202 --> 59:43.037
Looks like the tables have turned!

59:44.289 --> 59:46.833
-[gasps]
-The king's fatherly instincts kicked in.

59:47.625 --> 59:48.793
I'm so relieved.

59:48.876 --> 59:49.752
Your Majesty!

59:51.879 --> 59:54.173
-I hope you'll be very careful.
-Why's that?

59:54.257 --> 59:55.633
Well, just look at her.

59:55.717 --> 59:59.846
What a wretched, ugly thing she is.
She's just a lowly beggar.

59:59.929 --> 01:00:03.057
She's probably lying
just to get some attention from you.

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:05.435
I certainly wouldn't trust her.

01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:07.520
[guests clamoring]

01:00:14.193 --> 01:00:15.778
-Go on.
-Yes, sir.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.864
[overlapping chatter]

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:20.992
Ridiculous.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.579
May I say something, please?

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.247
[guest quiet down]

01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:32.045
I find it baffling that you people
refuse to believe in your very own prince.

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:36.049
Are you saying that you believe

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.718
that the mystery woman
is telling the truth?

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:40.261
Yes.

01:00:41.262 --> 01:00:42.889
But she looks very…

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:46.059
Please don't tell me you think
she's lying because she's ugly.

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:48.478
That logic wouldn't stand up in court.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.273
But she's just a lowly person.

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:55.151
There's no guarantee
that she's telling the truth.

01:00:55.234 --> 01:00:56.986
Maybe she just wants money or attention.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:59.822
You seem very suspicious of her.

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:03.785
The prince's new outfit,

01:01:03.868 --> 01:01:06.913
was it custom-made
especially for tonight's ball?

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.040
Yes, that's correct.

01:01:09.123 --> 01:01:10.792
And can you tell me what this is?

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:16.589
I found it on the floor
where the prince was being intercepted.

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.885
-What is that?
-It's a thorn, Your Highness.

01:01:22.303 --> 01:01:24.972
Just think about where the thorns are.

01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:27.809
Ow! Ouch!

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:29.519
[sighs]

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.773
Thorns like these grow in the woods
near the hill where the prince was.

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.858
[suspenseful music playing]

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:38.736
[Red Riding Hood] Think about it.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.613
When could a thorn
have gotten on his clothes

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:43.074
if he wore them
for the first time today?

01:01:43.157 --> 01:01:45.034
There's only one explanation for it,

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.330
which is that this afternoon,
the prince walked over to the green hill.

01:01:49.997 --> 01:01:52.250
Incredible logic, Detective Riding Hood.

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:54.127
So that means
the prince's story checks out?

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:56.212
You are correct.

01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:58.256
Your Majesty!

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.427
-Go and bring the prince back here.
-Right away.

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.095
-Go on!
-[man] Yes, sir.

01:02:12.353 --> 01:02:13.187
[sighs]

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.273
What made you change your mind?

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:17.650
My son,

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:22.071
because your alibi has been
corroborated by a credible witness,

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.365
you are now free to go.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.743
[guests murmuring]

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.497
Everyone,

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:35.585
I'm sorry to have kept you here
for so long.

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.257
You are all dismissed. You can go.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.593
[guests murmuring]

-Cinderella, let's go.
-[Cinderella] Huh?

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.105
Excuse me, please.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.316
Oh, please wait!

01:02:58.399 --> 01:03:00.735
Wait, Prince.
Please look at my lovely Anne!

01:03:00.818 --> 01:03:03.738
Look at her voluptuous bod!

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.325
Oh, Your Highness,
don't you just love my short hair?

01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:12.497
I would do anything at all to be with you.
Anything… you want.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:13.748
-Stop!
-Your Highness!

01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:15.833
-[clock-tower bell rings]
-Uh…

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.502
I haven't given up yet!

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:21.047
And we still really like you!

Prince Gilbert, I'm sorry!
I have to leave right now.

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:51.077
Wait a minute! Just tell me your name!

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.370
I'm sorry! I can't!

01:03:52.453 --> 01:03:53.788
We're heading off now!

Thank you. I appreciate it.

-[Red Riding Hood] Whoa! Ow!

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:11.837
-[Margot] Ow!
-Huh?

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.006
Hey! Who in the world are you?

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.466
Right back at you!

01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:18.177
Oh, my name is Margot.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.471
-Margot?
-[Margot sighs]

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:24.183
You're Cinderella's other sister.

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:26.852
Huh? You know Cinderella?

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:31.232
Oh, actually,
I don't care about her at all.

01:08:31.315 --> 01:08:34.235
Will you just help me?
Those soldiers are chasing me.

01:08:34.318 --> 01:08:36.403
What? Why? What did you do?

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:38.280
Uh,

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.158
well, I…

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.078
[breathing shakily]

01:08:44.161 --> 01:08:46.539
I killed Mr. Hans, the hairdresser!

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:49.458
[suspenseful music playing]

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:54.630
She won't have gotten very far! Fan out!

01:08:54.713 --> 01:08:56.006
[men] Yes, sir!

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.302
Mmm.

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:05.850
This scone is absolutely delicious
with raspberry jam!

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:08.102
How can you eat in a situation like this?

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:12.481
Hans sent me a personalized letter.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:15.317
He said he wanted
to cut my hair specially,

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.069
just in time for the ball.

01:09:18.195 --> 01:09:21.240
It said, "Meet me at my house
at four o'clock. Hans."

01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:24.076
-[knock on door]
-[Margot] Mr. Hans!

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.245
It's me, Margot.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.084
I'm coming in.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:37.339
I was so happy to get your invitation.

01:09:38.799 --> 01:09:39.842
Hmm?

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.183
-[thud]
-[Margot gasps]

01:09:47.266 --> 01:09:49.268
[suspenseful music playing]

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:52.855
[Margot] After I got hit,
I started feeling woozy,

01:09:52.938 --> 01:09:54.190
but when I tried to turn around…

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:55.149
[Margot] Ow!

01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:58.736
Is that blood? Wha… What's happening?

01:09:58.819 --> 01:10:01.530
…something hit me again
from behind.

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:06.952
You couldn't see the attacker?

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.167
-Let me look.
-What?

01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:15.419
Ah. Ah, ah, ah.

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:17.630
-Ow.
-It's true.

01:10:17.713 --> 01:10:18.797
[Margot] Ow.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.257
Looks like someone hit you twice.

01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:23.552
When I woke up,
my head was really hurting.

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:25.512
[grunts]

01:10:28.432 --> 01:10:29.516
[winces]

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:32.394
Oh. [groans]

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:35.856
[Margot] Then, I looked up,
and in front of me…

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:39.151
Huh?

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.779
[Margot] As soon as I saw Mr. Hans,

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.781
I knew that he was dead.

01:10:45.324 --> 01:10:48.285
But then, I noticed something in my hand.

01:10:49.161 --> 01:10:51.038
[screams]

01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:53.958
[Red Riding Hood] Hang on.

01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:58.671
So you can't actually remember
whether you killed him or not?

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:00.506
Right.

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:04.802
But it seems as though
I'm the only one who could've done it.

01:11:06.011 --> 01:11:08.055
[sobs]

01:11:08.138 --> 01:11:11.642
You've gotta calm down. Do you think
you can remember anything else?

01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:13.102
Uh,

01:11:14.478 --> 01:11:15.646
uh,

01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:18.023
well…

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:21.735
Oh, yeah.

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:22.945
[grunts]

01:11:34.748 --> 01:11:38.252
I saw my sister Anne's hair
on Mr. Hans's desk.

01:11:38.335 --> 01:11:39.962
Anne loved her long hair so much

01:11:40.045 --> 01:11:42.172
and would never have let
anyone cut it off.

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:43.090
What did you do?

01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:47.845
Well, I'd heard
some rumors about Mr. Hans.

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:50.347
And one of them
was that he was cutting off

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.349
girls' long, beautiful hair
against their will

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:54.018
and keeping it for himself.

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.855
I thought it was a lie someone
was spreading because they were jealous.

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:02.192
And then, I realized something.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:07.156
I thought that Hans probably cut off
Anne's hair against her will!

01:12:07.239 --> 01:12:11.785
And that must have gotten me so mad
that I murdered Mr. Hans!

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:15.331
[gasps] Oh, oh,
that must be what happened!

01:12:15.414 --> 01:12:16.957
Ah!

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:18.250
Just try to calm down.

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:21.170
And then what did you do
after that, Margot?

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.757
I wanted to try to cover it all up.

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.676
[curious music playing]

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:38.604
[Margot] I put Mr. Hans in a cart.

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:45.736
And then hid in the forest by the road
until I saw a carriage come by.

01:12:45.819 --> 01:12:47.154
[gasps]

01:12:47.237 --> 01:12:50.199
Making it seem like
the carriage accidentally run him over?

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:52.534
That's right.

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:57.247
Eventually, a really
strange-looking carriage came along.

01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:12.137
-[thud]
-[horses neigh]

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:16.600
I rolled him down the hill and ran
as fast as I could when it hit him.

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:18.894
What happened next?

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:24.233
Well, I mean, I was supposed
to go to the ball, but

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:27.528
I just didn't really wanna go after that.

01:13:28.987 --> 01:13:31.365
I kept thinking about what might happen
if someone found out.

01:13:31.448 --> 01:13:33.575
Ow! [groans]

01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:37.538
But I didn't feel like going home either,
so I just wandered around the woods.

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:42.042
Then one of the guards
saw me wandering around.

01:13:42.626 --> 01:13:43.877
[Chamberlain] There they are!

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:45.003
[men] Get them!

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:47.464
[Margot] What?

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:50.592
No! No! Help me!

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:52.886
[whimpers]

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:56.014
There! You've been looking for Margot.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:58.809
She just confessed
to the murder of Mr. Hans. Take her away.

01:13:58.892 --> 01:14:02.312
Huh? Is this a joke?
You said you were gonna help me out.

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:04.648
I never said anything of the sort.

01:14:04.731 --> 01:14:05.607
Huh?

01:14:06.483 --> 01:14:07.901
I just can't believe you.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:10.904
Answer me! Oh, you're such a meanie! No!

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:13.657
-[magical tinkle]
-[Margot] Let me go! Ah!

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.993
[yelling]

01:14:28.922 --> 01:14:30.716
Detective Little Red Riding Hood!

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:33.093
[chuckles] Am I ever glad to see you.

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:36.889
I'm quite impressed that you managed
to get a confession out of her.

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:40.184
I'm going to go report
this good news to the king. [chuckles]

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.562
-She isn't the murderer, Lord Chamberlain.
-Huh?

01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:47.107
She needed to learn a lesson,
because she's a big bully.

01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:49.443
Oh.

01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:50.527
-Lord Chamberlain
-Yes?

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:51.862
I have some information.

01:14:52.529 --> 01:14:54.448
I wondered if we could go
to Mr. Hans's house.

01:14:55.115 --> 01:14:57.868
Oh, sure. I would be honored
to take you there.

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:00.746
[suspenseful music playing]

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:24.603
I don't think this is Mr. Hans's blood.

01:15:25.812 --> 01:15:28.857
No, we believe these blood stains
are more than a year old.

01:15:29.399 --> 01:15:31.443
Hans's bleeding was internal.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.946
His injury couldn't have produced
this much blood.

01:15:59.846 --> 01:16:00.973
[clock-tower bell rings]

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:02.599
[distorted whirring]

01:16:04.184 --> 01:16:05.769
[clock-tower bell rings]

01:16:08.855 --> 01:16:10.232
[clock-tower bell rings]

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:15.571
-[boing noises]
-It all makes sense now.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.447
-Lord Chamberlain.
-Yes?

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.866
Could you please help me
with something else?

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:23.120
With pleasure, Detective Riding Hood.

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:26.290
-[chickens clucking]
-[goat bleats]

01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:33.088
-[birds chirping]
-[rooster crows]

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.340
[sighs]

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:20.969
Prince Gilbert.

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:25.682
The prince is looking for the woman
to whom this glass slipper belongs.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:32.689
Now, we know that this glass slipper
will only fit upon the foot of its owner.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.567
Servant, what is your name?

01:17:37.402 --> 01:17:39.863
Cinderella, sir. That's my name.

01:17:39.946 --> 01:17:42.491
Cinderella, will you try this on, please?

01:17:44.534 --> 01:17:47.245
Yes. I'll try it on if you wish.

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:54.586
[emotional music playing]

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:22.114
Oh my!

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:23.281
Oh my goodness!

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.701
-It's a perfect fit!
-[sighs]

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.621
-So it is.
-[sighs]

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:30.664
[Gilbert] I found you.

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.214
You can seize her now.

01:18:39.756 --> 01:18:41.717
-[men] Yes, sir!
-Huh?

01:18:42.759 --> 01:18:44.886
What? What is this?

01:18:48.765 --> 01:18:52.185
Red Riding Hood, you can vouch for me!
I'm innocent! Tell them!

01:18:54.604 --> 01:18:55.647
Hey, Cinderella.

01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:57.315
Huh?

01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:01.319
I have a question for you.
Why are your feet covered in so many cuts?

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:05.449
I told you. You remember, don't you?

01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:08.994
These cuts are from picking raspberries
in the woods, because of all the thorns.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:12.038
Cinderella, what happened to your shoes?

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.958
I told you. Margot took them and I--

01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:16.626
Hey, Cinderella.

01:19:17.377 --> 01:19:21.423
How is it that you're such a good liar,
but your plan is so sloppy?

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:26.428
Margot didn't kill Mr. Hans.

01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:27.512
It was you.

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:33.685
You know that's not true.

01:19:35.645 --> 01:19:37.355
I had a feeling
you weren't telling the truth

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.065
from the first moment I met you.

01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:42.527
And that's why I decided
to go along to the ball too.

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.112
What?

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:46.114
[Red Riding Hood]
The first strange thing you said

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:49.367
was when you told me
that Margot threw your shoes away.

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:51.912
And you thought
I wasn't telling the truth?

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:56.208
Margot, your sister,
loves raspberry jam, doesn't she?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.794
If she had thrown your shoes away,

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:01.046
then you couldn't have picked raspberries

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.798
in the forest filled with thorns.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:04.966
I was being bullied by her though.

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:08.470
If you think I'm the killer,
I would've had to have a… a motive, right?

01:20:08.553 --> 01:20:11.264
I didn't have any reason
to want to kill Mr. Hans.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:13.934
Your motive was

01:20:15.435 --> 01:20:17.229
that you wanted to become beautiful.

01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:20.649
[birds chirping]

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:31.159
Do you want to become beautiful?

01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:33.245
Huh?

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:37.332
[Red Riding Hood] I think
Mr. Hans could see your natural beauty.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:43.004
And then he started obsessing
about cutting off your hair.

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:46.800
You do know who I am, don't you?

01:20:46.883 --> 01:20:48.885
Of course, how could you not?

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:50.762
Royal hairdresser.

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.556
Hair-obsessed.

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:54.182
Beauty's the game.

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:56.101
Hans is my name.

01:20:57.936 --> 01:21:01.356
I'm responsible
for cutting the king's hair.

01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:03.733
Right? You've heard of me, right?

01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:09.781
Why don't you come to my place?

01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:12.284
I'll give you a special cut.

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:13.827
Just for you.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:19.040
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:27.966
[Red Riding Hood]
That must have made you feel good

01:21:28.633 --> 01:21:30.802
since everyone was always bullying you

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.637
and making you feel ugly.

01:21:33.471 --> 01:21:35.891
So having a famous hairdresser
suddenly offer

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.976
to make you beautiful
must've been exciting, right?

01:21:40.478 --> 01:21:44.065
But then,
the situation became clear to you.

01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:56.411
-No! What are you doing?
-[Hans grunts]

01:21:57.662 --> 01:21:58.747
[Hans sighs]

01:22:00.373 --> 01:22:04.210
Your hair will become beautiful.

01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:10.842
In this country, hair that is
more beautiful than what I create

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.678
simply should not exist!

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.180
-[grunts]
-[grunts]

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:18.934
[suspenseful music playing]

01:22:21.728 --> 01:22:24.230
[Red Riding Hood] You killed Mr. Hans.

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:29.861
Then you tried to blame everything
on your sister Margot.

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:43.708
I WILL CUT YOUR HAIR FOR THE UPCOMING BALL

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.460
[Red Riding Hood]
Pretending to be Mr. Hans,

01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:47.921
you wrote a letter inviting Margot over.

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:54.344
And when she arrived at Mr. Hans's house,
you knocked her out and left her there

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:58.181
knowing the prince's messenger
would find her at five o'clock.

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:00.809
And that was supposed to be the end of it.

01:23:01.559 --> 01:23:02.727
Except,

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.772
then, Cinderella, you made one mistake.

01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:08.066
[Margot] I'm coming in.

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:12.862
I was so happy to get your invitation.

01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:20.120
[Margot grunts]

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.789
[dramatic violin music playing]

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.724
[Red Riding Hood] You had failed
to knock Margot out,

01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:44.269
but the whetstone was too far away,
so you made a quick decision.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:46.104
-[grunts]
-[Margot grunts]

01:23:47.605 --> 01:23:50.608
[Red Riding Hood] The impact of it
broke the heel on your glass slipper.

01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:54.279
And here's the piece from that slipper.

01:23:55.321 --> 01:23:57.532
It was hidden in the folds
of Margot's dress.

01:23:58.783 --> 01:24:00.827
I guess that you didn't notice

01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:02.787
when this piece of glass
came off your slipper,

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:06.958
because you were too busy
knocking your sister out cold.

01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:11.379
And after that, all you had to do was
wait for the messenger to get there

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:12.964
and find them both.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:14.799
Margot would become the suspect,

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:18.428
and you would be able
to walk away from it without a trace.

01:24:19.345 --> 01:24:22.515
However, there was no way
for you to know

01:24:22.599 --> 01:24:24.434
that the prince changed his mind.

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:29.773
The messenger never showed,
and Margot wasn't discovered at the house.

01:24:31.941 --> 01:24:34.986
That's all just… just speculation.

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:38.448
And also, if the glass is
from the killer's slipper,

01:24:38.531 --> 01:24:39.991
then, wait a second.

01:24:47.874 --> 01:24:51.419
See? Not chipped. And these glass slippers
obviously belong to me.

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:54.464
So that's proof. There's no way
that I could've murdered him.

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.801
Yes, that is true. This piece

01:24:57.884 --> 01:24:59.969
doesn't belong
to that pair of slippers.

01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:01.346
There you go.

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:02.597
So that proves it.

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.558
These slippers can only fit
the first person that wears them.

01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:08.520
That piece of glass
doesn't belong to these shoes.

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:12.649
There were so many people at the ball
with glass slippers thanks to Tekla.

01:25:12.732 --> 01:25:14.400
Someone else must've done it.

01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:17.237
I'm sorry. It can't be anyone but you.

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:21.449
It isn't true, but if you're gonna
keep accusing me, then where's the proof?

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:24.202
If you like, Cinderella,

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:28.540
let's talk about the glass slipper
that's on your left foot.

01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:32.544
I know you left one shoe
on the castle stairs last night.

01:25:33.878 --> 01:25:36.631
-But it wasn't that one.
-What?

01:25:36.714 --> 01:25:38.466
The one you're wearing right now…

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:46.432
was buried in the earth,

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:49.185
inside the grave of your beloved pigeon.

01:25:52.021 --> 01:25:55.483
You had two pairs of glass slippers.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:57.819
The left glass slipper,

01:25:57.902 --> 01:26:01.072
the one that you accidentally left behind
at the castle last night

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:02.866
is over there.

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.038
The right-side shoe that pairs

01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:12.083
with the glass slipper
you are currently wearing…

01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:14.961
Is right here.

01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:17.172
We found this buried
in the pigeon's grave.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.384
[Red Riding Hood] Lord Chamberlain,
please take this piece of glass.

01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:32.687
It fits perfectly, Detective.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.066
[Red Riding Hood]
When I first met you, you were barefoot.

01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:40.653
But not because Margot
had taken away your shoes.

01:26:41.654 --> 01:26:43.448
You hit Margot with a shoe from a pair

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:45.325
that Tekla
had already transformed for you.

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:48.620
But the heel broke,
so then you had to bury them…

01:26:50.747 --> 01:26:54.083
which means that yesterday,
you actually met Tekla twice

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:56.753
and received two pairs of slippers.

01:26:57.712 --> 01:27:00.089
I was there the second time you saw her.

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:02.926
The first time must've been
after you killed Hans

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.887
and after you delivered
the letter to Margot.

01:27:07.764 --> 01:27:09.682
That must be it, right, Tekla?

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:12.310
[Tekla] That's exactly right.

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:14.771
-[magical chimes tinkle]
-Whoa! What the heck?

01:27:14.854 --> 01:27:17.357
[laughing]

01:27:17.982 --> 01:27:19.692
Oh, I get it now.

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:21.819
You were also Cinderella.

01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:25.823
As Red Riding Hood just stated,

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:28.993
I did change her shoes
into a pair of glass slippers.

01:27:29.494 --> 01:27:31.287
And do you remember what time it was?

01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:34.207
I think it was around three o'clock.

01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:37.126
The castle bell rang. Uh, uh…

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:38.461
It rang three times.

01:27:39.212 --> 01:27:40.880
I think you must be confused.

01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:45.176
Yesterday, I met you with Red Riding Hood,
and you said, "It's nice to meet you too."

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:47.845
If it was the second time,
then why didn't you say so?

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:51.391
You really want me to explain that to you?

01:27:51.975 --> 01:27:52.892
Well, I don't know.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.436
Hey, Barbara?

01:27:56.312 --> 01:27:57.522
Mm-hmm! Mmm!

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.066
The second time
that you two met each other,

01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:02.944
you looked like
somebody completely different,

01:28:03.027 --> 01:28:04.237
thanks to my magic.

01:28:05.071 --> 01:28:08.866
It's totally understandable that Tekla
thought you were a different person.

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:10.702
[scoffs]

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:17.834
Thanks for being witnesses,
Tekla and Barbara.

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:21.838
Wait, that's all you wanted from me?
Is that… is that it?

01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:24.215
Mm-hmm. We're glad we could help.

01:28:24.924 --> 01:28:27.176
Now, we'll say goodbye!

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:29.178
[magical chimes tinkle]

01:28:29.262 --> 01:28:31.264
[mysterious music playing]

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:34.225
Shall we continue?

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:39.063
If I had asked you directly
to try these glass slippers on for me,

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:40.898
you could've easily refused.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:45.987
That's why I asked the prince to help me.

01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:50.616
If the prince was the one
handing you the slippers,

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:53.911
I knew that you
couldn't possibly refuse him.

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:56.622
[clock-tower bell rings]

01:28:58.166 --> 01:28:59.459
How do you know for sure?

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.003
What?

01:29:03.129 --> 01:29:05.131
How do you know
that the slipper on my left foot

01:29:05.214 --> 01:29:08.134
and that broken right-foot slipper
are the correct pair?

01:29:08.217 --> 01:29:11.262
Aren't they both glass slippers?
You haven't proved anything.

01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:14.057
I think that you switched
the slippers secretly

01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:17.185
so you could frame me for the murder.
That makes the most sense.

01:29:17.268 --> 01:29:19.020
[clock-tower bell rings]

01:29:19.103 --> 01:29:20.271
Cinderella,

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:24.025
the fact that the slipper fits you

01:29:26.569 --> 01:29:28.112
means that you're the killer.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.198
[clock-tower bell rings]

01:29:30.281 --> 01:29:31.866
[magical chimes tinkle]

[magical chimes tinkle]

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:44.462
[gasps] What the heck?

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:46.839
Oh my gosh.

01:29:46.923 --> 01:29:49.092
[suspenseful music playing]

01:29:55.848 --> 01:29:56.974
You're right.

01:29:59.727 --> 01:30:00.978
I did it all.

01:30:01.979 --> 01:30:03.064
I'm the murderer.

01:30:07.151 --> 01:30:08.111
I'm the one.

01:30:10.279 --> 01:30:11.989
I'm the one who killed Hans.

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:21.457
Hey, tell me, Red Riding Hood.

01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:27.797
How did you know that I buried
those slippers in the pigeon's grave?

01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:32.844
You know better than anyone

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:35.847
that people only want
to see what's beautiful.

01:30:37.306 --> 01:30:39.308
So you buried it in the pigeon's grave,

01:30:40.601 --> 01:30:43.688
because you knew no one
cared about an ugly, dead pigeon.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.150
You understand,

01:30:48.526 --> 01:30:50.570
more than anyone in the world,

01:30:50.653 --> 01:30:52.238
how the people here think.

01:30:58.161 --> 01:30:59.704
I just thought that it was

01:31:00.329 --> 01:31:02.331
a really good hiding place.

01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:07.795
It sure was.

01:31:08.754 --> 01:31:11.299
It was actually the perfect hiding place.

01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:18.764
[grunts]

01:31:18.848 --> 01:31:20.308
[panting]

01:31:20.391 --> 01:31:22.393
[suspenseful music continues]

01:31:51.547 --> 01:31:52.757
I should've known.

01:31:53.549 --> 01:31:55.468
I've been unlucky my whole life.

01:31:57.803 --> 01:31:59.722
I wish I had never met you.

01:32:06.145 --> 01:32:07.188
Cinderella.

01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:10.775
Prince Gilbert.

01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:16.030
You don't have to mean it, but

01:32:17.406 --> 01:32:19.033
can you tell me once more?

01:32:20.826 --> 01:32:22.995
Please just tell me one more time.

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:26.207
Tell you what?

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.211
That I'm very,

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:33.589
very beautiful.

01:32:46.686 --> 01:32:47.770
You are very…

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.233
disappointing.

01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:55.278
[somber music playing]

01:33:00.533 --> 01:33:01.659
[sobbing]

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:18.968
Take her.

01:33:19.051 --> 01:33:20.136
[man] Yes, sir.

01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:35.234
[Chamberlain] Prince.

01:33:39.071 --> 01:33:40.990
Red Riding Hood, thank you.

01:33:41.616 --> 01:33:44.118
Because of your help,
we were able to solve the case.

01:33:44.744 --> 01:33:46.120
Oh, are you sure?

01:33:46.829 --> 01:33:47.663
What?

01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:53.336
There's one other little problem
that we need to solve, Prince Gilbert.

01:33:54.545 --> 01:33:55.546
There's something else?

01:33:56.339 --> 01:33:59.133
Don't you want
to discuss your future princess?

01:34:00.176 --> 01:34:04.472
Even though you chose Cinderella
at the ball, you can't be with a murderer.

01:34:04.555 --> 01:34:05.723
Right.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:07.099
That doesn't matter now.

01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:10.686
Even if Cinderella
hadn't been a lying criminal,

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:13.814
I still wouldn't have chosen her
to be my princess.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:14.732
Oh?

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:17.526
You seemed to enjoy
her company at the ball.

01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:19.570
Hmm. I had to dance with someone.

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:22.323
I wanted to make my father happy,
at least for a bit.

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:25.451
Ah. You're quite the heartbreaker.

01:34:26.994 --> 01:34:29.205
Well, I do apologize for that.

01:34:29.872 --> 01:34:32.583
But I… I already found

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:35.961
the person that I want.

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.974
So, about this person…

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:53.270
There was a strange sort of coincidence.

01:34:54.897 --> 01:34:59.110
Miss Remi, why do you think
she actually disappeared a year ago?

01:34:59.985 --> 01:35:02.530
Do you really think
that was the king's fault?

01:35:03.989 --> 01:35:06.117
I don't think there's another explanation.

01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:12.373
When I investigated Mr. Hans's house,
I found a bunch of old blood stains.

01:35:16.419 --> 01:35:17.837
What are you saying?

01:35:20.923 --> 01:35:23.884
That Remi was attacked by Mr. Hans.

01:35:23.968 --> 01:35:25.970
[mysterious music playing]

01:35:26.512 --> 01:35:27.471
[sighs]

01:35:28.514 --> 01:35:29.348
[sighs]

01:35:30.433 --> 01:35:31.350
I saw it.

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:34.770
A lock of hair
that clearly belonged to Remi.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:39.817
I think when Hans was attacking Remi,
she fought back fiercely.

01:35:41.193 --> 01:35:42.445
[Remi gasping]

01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:48.367
-[grunting]
-[laughing]

01:35:58.794 --> 01:36:02.965
Remi would've had a huge scar on her face,
so she disappeared.

01:36:03.799 --> 01:36:04.800
Why though?

01:36:05.468 --> 01:36:07.803
How could she decide
to run away like that?

01:36:07.887 --> 01:36:10.014
I would still love her
with a scar on her face.

01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:13.392
The problem is this country.

01:36:13.976 --> 01:36:15.144
What?

01:36:15.227 --> 01:36:19.732
In this country, the most important thing
is to be beautiful.

01:36:20.691 --> 01:36:23.152
And the princess
to the prince of such a country

01:36:23.235 --> 01:36:24.862
would need to be especially beautiful.

01:36:27.490 --> 01:36:30.326
With such a deep cut on her face,
Remi didn't

01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:32.870
think she was beautiful enough for you.

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:36.624
And that's why she chose to disappear.

01:36:40.044 --> 01:36:41.212
Do you agree?

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:52.515
Who are you?

01:37:01.690 --> 01:37:02.691
Remi.

01:37:07.112 --> 01:37:08.322
Remi,

01:37:08.405 --> 01:37:11.283
I've been looking for you.
I looked everywhere for you!

01:37:12.076 --> 01:37:13.327
I don't deserve

01:37:14.954 --> 01:37:17.957
such kind words
from someone like you anymore.

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:24.630
An ugly woman with a disfigured face…
doesn't deserve to be with a prince.

01:37:24.713 --> 01:37:27.007
-You know that's not who I am.
-I can't!

01:37:27.633 --> 01:37:29.593
You're a prince and you deserve better.

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:32.012
Someone who's beautiful.

01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:35.307
Please, Your Majesty.

01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:37.810
Forget about me.

01:37:39.019 --> 01:37:40.104
Remi,

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:42.231
don't say that.

01:37:42.314 --> 01:37:43.190
[gasps]

01:37:49.154 --> 01:37:53.033
Excuse me.
Would it be all right if I said something?

01:38:00.749 --> 01:38:01.667
Remi,

01:38:02.626 --> 01:38:03.836
on the day of the ball,

01:38:03.919 --> 01:38:06.297
when you saw the prince
sitting on the hill,

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.841
why did you spend
two whole hours watching him?

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:11.802
Well, because…

01:38:13.929 --> 01:38:17.349
I think it's because you're
still in love with the prince.

01:38:18.642 --> 01:38:19.727
Isn't that right?

01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:27.067
That's why, even though you disappeared,

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:29.862
you've still been watching
the prince from a distance.

01:38:31.530 --> 01:38:33.198
And to make sure no one noticed,

01:38:33.282 --> 01:38:37.494
you transformed yourself
and made yourself ugly.

01:38:40.289 --> 01:38:42.291
[emotional music playing]

01:38:43.834 --> 01:38:44.668
Remi.

01:39:00.017 --> 01:39:00.851
Remi.

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:05.773
You're still so beautiful.

01:39:09.026 --> 01:39:10.611
And I'm in love with you.

01:39:12.947 --> 01:39:14.156
Oh, Gilbert.

01:39:18.994 --> 01:39:20.996
[uplifting music playing]

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:46.981
THANK YOU

01:39:51.944 --> 01:39:55.030
Little Red Riding Hood,
thank you so very much.

01:39:56.949 --> 01:39:58.367
It was my pleasure.

01:39:58.867 --> 01:40:00.911
Prince Gilbert and Remi,

01:40:01.578 --> 01:40:04.039
it's so wonderful
that the king approves of this.

01:40:06.208 --> 01:40:09.253
We have you to thank.
You showed us what's important.

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:11.630
Love's the only thing that matters.
Thank you.

01:40:14.216 --> 01:40:15.342
I wish you happiness.

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:18.721
Now then, I'll be on my way.

01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:24.268
[narrator] And that is how Cinderella
and Little Red Riding Hood's story

01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:25.686
came to an end.

01:40:25.769 --> 01:40:27.646
I'll miss you, Detective!

01:40:35.571 --> 01:40:40.826
[narrator] But it was
just one of many stories.

01:40:42.494 --> 01:40:46.957
Red Riding Hood's life
will have many more tales

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:50.627
full of adventure and magic.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:53.714
-[snapping sound]
-Ah! Ah! Ay! [groans]

01:40:53.797 --> 01:40:55.632
Oh, these thorns again.

01:40:56.884 --> 01:40:57.968
[groans]

01:40:59.011 --> 01:40:59.970
I guess

01:41:00.679 --> 01:41:03.682
lots of things that are beautiful
also have thorns.

01:41:04.683 --> 01:41:06.685
