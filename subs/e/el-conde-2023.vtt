19:54.458 --> 19:56.250
-I thought they'd already got him.
-Who has?

19:56.333 --> 19:57.250
The police have.

19:57.333 --> 20:00.375
That they don't come
looking here, is all I ask.

20:01.041 --> 20:03.958
I think inheritance is something
one should be able to enjoy now,

20:04.041 --> 20:05.333
and not wait your whole life for.

20:05.416 --> 20:06.833
It's not like it's your whole life…

20:06.916 --> 20:08.750
But there are people
who live far too long.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.875
-You think?
-Yes, I do.

20:11.791 --> 20:15.333
[whimsical waltz playing]

20:17.541 --> 20:20.500
[British woman] They screwed
all the women and all the men.

20:20.583 --> 20:22.125
They crashed all the cars,

20:22.208 --> 20:23.291
held all the parties,

20:23.375 --> 20:27.750
and squandered all the state's money
on cheap wine and imitation velvet.

20:27.833 --> 20:30.875
They won wars
and founded the country anew,

20:30.958 --> 20:34.791
and then they were left powerless,
stripped of their honor.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.791
[creaking]

20:53.458 --> 20:54.583
[exhaling sharply]

21:04.291 --> 21:06.291
[whimsical waltz continues]

21:23.500 --> 21:25.125
EXTRA CONCENTRATED AJÍ

21:25.208 --> 21:27.208
[steaming]

21:48.500 --> 21:50.500
[sizzling]

22:00.708 --> 22:04.583
[British woman] The whole family knows
the captain general is a vampire.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.833
The only one in the family.

22:07.458 --> 22:10.000
He has not bitten
a single one of his children,

22:10.083 --> 22:13.250
preferring that they live
in accordance with natural order.

22:24.291 --> 22:26.916
-[door opens]
-[waltz stops abruptly]

22:27.000 --> 22:28.416
[footsteps approaching]

22:46.291 --> 22:47.458
Good evening.

22:47.541 --> 22:49.083
[all] Good evening, General!

22:49.166 --> 22:53.250
[British woman] Who said that
vampires live loveless lives?

22:53.333 --> 22:56.958
The trouble is that love dies
before the body does.

22:57.041 --> 23:01.625
The vampire knows, tragically,
that love is not eternal.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.333
[soft choral music playing]

23:23.583 --> 23:27.083
This is the young body
that will make them suffer.

23:27.166 --> 23:29.458
This white, innocent flesh

23:29.541 --> 23:32.166
will destroy dreams and bring misery.

23:32.250 --> 23:35.000
She knows it. Everyone knows it.

23:35.083 --> 23:36.958
This was why she was chosen.

23:39.041 --> 23:42.291
She was also chosen
for her gift for mathematics.

23:43.083 --> 23:46.750
Her ability to calculate unspeakable sums.

23:47.250 --> 23:50.500
She might have been a surveyor
or an engineer,

23:52.125 --> 23:54.416
but God stole her heart.

23:56.375 --> 23:58.333
-[inhales deeply]
-Or so she believed.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.833
[whispering] Hail Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners…

24:05.916 --> 24:08.500
[voice breaking] …now
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.500
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

24:10.583 --> 24:14.791
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

24:14.875 --> 24:17.083
[utensils clinking]

24:19.833 --> 24:22.041
And to what do I owe this wonderful visit?

24:25.041 --> 24:26.666
We were worried, Papa.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.041
Worried. Of course.

24:29.125 --> 24:33.000
Because I have various times almost died,
and various times said goodbye.

24:33.083 --> 24:36.833
Someone has been eating hearts
in Santiago, Papa. Mm.

24:36.916 --> 24:38.083
Someone?

24:39.708 --> 24:41.791
It could have been me.

24:41.875 --> 24:43.458
But it doesn't make any sense.

24:43.541 --> 24:46.375
Why would I want to keep living
in a country that hates me?

24:46.458 --> 24:47.875
They don't hate you.

24:48.583 --> 24:49.583
No.

24:49.666 --> 24:52.875
-They should hate me.
-They are ungrateful.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.083
That's true.

24:55.166 --> 24:57.791
They are ungrateful. What a pain.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.125
But it is also true I made mistakes.

25:05.458 --> 25:07.166
Accounting mistakes.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.541
Oh, yes?

25:12.208 --> 25:14.708
-Well, you all know.
-Know what, Papa?

25:14.791 --> 25:16.916
No, we don't know anything.

25:18.041 --> 25:19.250
It's a mess.

25:19.333 --> 25:23.125
Your mother asks me every day
about secret bank accounts,

25:23.208 --> 25:26.041
hidden properties all around the world,

25:26.125 --> 25:27.750
and I can't remember anything.

25:27.833 --> 25:30.083
I can't remember.
What can I do? I don't remember.

25:30.166 --> 25:34.000
Although, the other day,
when I was calmer, I remembered something.

25:35.041 --> 25:36.041
And?

25:37.125 --> 25:40.041
I have some old books down in the cellar.

25:40.125 --> 25:43.625
And there, along with…
with a lawyer and ex-minister,

25:43.708 --> 25:44.875
we hid some papers.

25:44.958 --> 25:48.875
I don't know, accounts,
receipts, commitments.

25:49.708 --> 25:53.833
I don't know. Things that may be
worth something, have some value.

25:53.916 --> 25:57.041
[British woman] The count has decided
to give his secret fortune

25:57.125 --> 25:57.958
to his children.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.458
This is enormously surprising.

26:01.958 --> 26:04.458
But this wait has been eternal.
I don't understand it.

26:04.541 --> 26:09.166
I don't understand why he should want
to throw away the money from our future.

26:09.250 --> 26:10.125
[son 1] Papa?

26:11.958 --> 26:13.083
Why now, Papa?

26:13.666 --> 26:16.666
Well, I'd forgotten I'd lost it.

26:17.375 --> 26:19.541
But I asked you that so often.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.041
Well, I couldn't remember,

26:21.125 --> 26:23.708
and now I do,
which is why I'm telling you.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.583
I don't see why you all have long faces.

26:27.666 --> 26:29.250
You should be happy.

26:30.041 --> 26:32.208
Those papers, if they're of any value,

26:32.291 --> 26:33.958
split them between you.

26:35.166 --> 26:38.333
Half's for your mother
and the other half for all of you.

26:38.416 --> 26:40.250
[British woman] I don't understand
what he feels

26:40.333 --> 26:43.541
for this dwarfish, hateful woman, Lucía.

26:43.625 --> 26:46.083
A peasant decked out in furs.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.583
All she's done
her whole life is open her legs

26:48.666 --> 26:51.208
and let a soldier fornicate with her.

26:51.291 --> 26:54.166
[groans] And now I'm leaving. I'm tired.

26:54.666 --> 26:56.125
I think I will die tonight.

26:57.583 --> 26:58.958
[Count groans]

26:59.833 --> 27:03.416
I wish you all the best of luck.
I love you very much.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.666
I truly do love you with all my heart.

27:08.083 --> 27:09.458
[grunts softly]

27:13.666 --> 27:14.625
[grunts]

27:16.500 --> 27:18.625
Permission to say something, my general.

27:18.708 --> 27:19.666
Hmm?

27:21.708 --> 27:22.833
Say it!

27:25.875 --> 27:27.583
I love you, my general.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.208
[lady of the house clears throat]

27:32.291 --> 27:33.291
Uh…

27:37.125 --> 27:38.666
I love you, Papa.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.666
-I love you.
-I love you.

27:40.750 --> 27:42.708
-I love you.
-I love you, Papi.

27:45.041 --> 27:46.083
Lucía.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.916
Don't make me say those
things in front of the children.

27:52.541 --> 27:53.958
I like you.

27:54.041 --> 27:55.583
You turn me on.

27:56.458 --> 27:57.958
You old prostitute!

28:01.333 --> 28:04.666
Will you show me the old cannons,
just before you die?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.291
Will you make me sweat?

28:07.000 --> 28:08.166
Just once.

28:10.291 --> 28:13.041
I'll make you sweat
like the horse of a bandit.

28:14.166 --> 28:16.458
-Mm.
-[military band playing cadence]

28:21.500 --> 28:24.625
[playing "Adiós al Séptimo de la Línea"]

29:13.125 --> 29:15.875
-[military anthem ends]
-[wind whistling]

29:19.083 --> 29:20.416
[door rattles]

29:27.250 --> 29:28.625
[distant creaking]

29:42.250 --> 29:44.250
[somber string music playing]

30:20.291 --> 30:22.291
[somber music continues]

30:37.083 --> 30:38.458
[air hissing]

31:00.625 --> 31:02.291
[British woman] In the late 1990s,

31:02.375 --> 31:05.083
in recognition
of his long service to dirty work,

31:05.166 --> 31:09.666
Fyodor was bitten by the count
and transformed into a vampire.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.125
He was always a ruthless murderer

31:13.208 --> 31:16.416
who learnt his craft
at the school of the Americas,

31:16.500 --> 31:19.333
and set up
the Villa Grimaldi concentration camp

31:19.416 --> 31:21.208
during the dictatorship,

31:21.291 --> 31:24.625
killing hundreds
of revolutionaries with his own hands.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.208
-[slurping]
-[music ends]

31:31.750 --> 31:34.250
You went out to hunt for those hearts.

31:35.041 --> 31:36.125
No, Señora.

31:36.208 --> 31:37.750
I don't need them.

32:00.708 --> 32:02.208
[British woman] Incredible, the butler

32:02.291 --> 32:04.416
and the lady of the house
in a secret romance.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.750
-An age-old but repulsive crime.
-[kissing wetly]

32:07.833 --> 32:09.750
The documents.

32:10.791 --> 32:11.791
Señora…

32:12.708 --> 32:14.166
And the cash.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Excuse me.

32:18.083 --> 32:21.291
[British woman] We can only assume
that Lucía knows that Fyodor

32:21.375 --> 32:23.333
could bite her one day,

32:23.416 --> 32:29.333
if the count continues refusing to do it,
as he has for the last 60 years.

32:34.458 --> 32:36.458
[papers rustling]

33:01.333 --> 33:03.333
[cart creaking]

33:12.958 --> 33:16.375
[Count sighs deeply] Why can't I die?

33:18.208 --> 33:19.791
[Lucía] Because you don't want to die.

33:19.875 --> 33:23.708
Of course I want to die.
I've been alive for 250 years.

33:23.791 --> 33:26.166
[Lucía] And we could live 250 years more.

33:26.250 --> 33:29.208
I don't want to live 250 more years.
Oh my God.

33:29.291 --> 33:30.833
But why not?

33:30.916 --> 33:33.000
Because I was treated like a thief.

33:33.791 --> 33:37.916
A soldier you can call a murderer,
anything, but not a thief.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.541
I killed hundreds of Reds.
Hundreds of Reds.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.000
And they will accuse me
all my life of stealing.

33:44.083 --> 33:47.833
They… they humiliated me.
[voice breaking] They humiliated me.

33:47.916 --> 33:50.416
But you did steal, right?

33:50.500 --> 33:51.708
[sighs exasperatedly]

33:52.750 --> 33:54.708
This is what we're gonna do.

33:54.791 --> 33:56.541
You bite me…

33:57.416 --> 33:59.708
and then we go out at night to hunt.

33:59.791 --> 34:00.833
Just blood.

34:00.916 --> 34:02.291
After that let's…

34:03.333 --> 34:06.416
go to the cellar
where you have all the hearts.

34:06.500 --> 34:10.250
We eat all of the hearts,
then we rejuvenate.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.583
We go to another country,

34:13.833 --> 34:14.958
with different names…

34:15.625 --> 34:17.291
-Fifteen years old.
-[chuckles]

34:18.791 --> 34:20.875
With a new army, you know?

34:20.958 --> 34:24.208
But I don't understand why I can't…
Why I'm unable to die.

34:27.875 --> 34:30.208
You put blood in my meals.

34:30.708 --> 34:34.333
You put blood in my food
so I can keep on living.

34:34.416 --> 34:36.083
-Huh?
-No.

34:38.708 --> 34:42.291
"President Allende,
the army will not betray you!"

34:42.791 --> 34:43.666
What?

34:44.375 --> 34:46.000
That's what I told him.

34:47.125 --> 34:50.208
Well? The next day I betrayed him.
I betrayed him.

34:50.791 --> 34:54.208
-[scoffs] The idea was mine.
-Yes, but no one knows that.

34:55.541 --> 34:57.583
That was a vengeance of mine.

34:58.958 --> 35:01.791
I had a mission. A mission to just smash.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.041
To smash the…

35:03.125 --> 35:05.583
The anarchists,
to smash the trade unionists,

35:05.666 --> 35:08.958
smash the republicans,
and the free slaves.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.708
But you fell in love with me.

35:10.791 --> 35:12.541
Sixty years we've been together.

35:12.625 --> 35:16.541
What else do you want? You've had it all.
Children, grandchildren.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.750
And you're the queen of this desert.

35:18.833 --> 35:21.250
Listen, what are you complaining about?

35:21.333 --> 35:26.166
We have a glass of brandy every night,
we talk, we sleep holding hands.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.333
What else is there?

35:28.416 --> 35:30.041
To be a beast just like you.

35:32.125 --> 35:33.208
[sighs]

35:37.541 --> 35:40.166
[daughter 2] No,
there have to be more papers.

35:40.250 --> 35:41.291
In English.

35:41.375 --> 35:46.541
Bank letters, bonds, vouchers,
bearer bonds, things like that.

35:47.375 --> 35:48.625
Like this?

35:50.208 --> 35:51.166
Let me see.

35:53.166 --> 35:54.291
And like this?

35:55.291 --> 35:56.208
[laughs]

35:58.208 --> 35:59.708
Is your friend coming?

35:59.791 --> 36:02.000
-She's not my friend.
-Who's coming?

36:02.083 --> 36:03.750
Did you let your accountant know?

36:03.833 --> 36:06.708
Yes, I did. He'll send an assistant
as he isn't able to come.

36:06.791 --> 36:07.916
What, now?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.791
-That's what we agreed on.
-[son 2] I didn't agree to anything.

36:10.875 --> 36:13.416
-Can we trust her?
-Totally. From a military family.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.083
-But a woman.
-[daughter 1] Yes.

36:15.166 --> 36:16.333
Excuse me.

36:17.625 --> 36:18.750
A young woman?

36:19.791 --> 36:22.291
-[daughter 1] Yes.
-[son 1] What does it matter?

36:22.875 --> 36:26.458
If she knows how to read this and doesn't
say anything to the press, she's perfect.

36:26.541 --> 36:27.958
Do we have to pay her?

36:28.041 --> 36:31.291
Of course we have to pay her,
and a lot, so she doesn't want revenge.

36:31.375 --> 36:32.708
Is this everything?

36:33.416 --> 36:35.666
You'd have to check with my general.

36:36.291 --> 36:37.666
But in principle, no.

36:39.125 --> 36:40.708
Then we're rich.

36:40.791 --> 36:42.500
Yes, of course.

36:45.125 --> 36:47.250
[pensive cello music playing]

36:56.375 --> 36:59.458
[engine rumbling]

37:35.083 --> 37:37.083
[wind howling]

37:51.125 --> 37:53.166
-Merci.
-If you please?

37:53.250 --> 37:54.250
Thank you.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
[fire crackling]

38:07.791 --> 38:09.916
[sighs] Good morning.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.083
Hello. Finally. Papa!

38:13.833 --> 38:14.833
What?

38:14.916 --> 38:17.291
It's the accountant
that's going to help us.

38:18.125 --> 38:19.625
What's her name?

38:20.208 --> 38:21.208
Carmen.

38:26.333 --> 38:27.708
Carmencita.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.791
[in French] I have come to count
your silver coins and weigh your gold.

38:33.291 --> 38:34.541
Discreetly, of course.

38:36.041 --> 38:39.666
That would be wonderful,
but I'm afraid there isn't much left.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.166
I'm poor.

38:41.708 --> 38:45.500
In that case, I will find money
you didn't even know you had.

38:45.583 --> 38:47.000
[son 1 in English] In French?

38:47.750 --> 38:50.500
[in French] Forgive me, but...
You understand my childish French?

38:50.583 --> 38:53.083
I'm forgetting
the language of my Sun King.

38:54.208 --> 38:56.583
It is the language of treason.

38:56.666 --> 38:58.750
And the war is never forgotten.

38:58.833 --> 39:00.541
[ominous music playing]

39:00.625 --> 39:01.750
Possibly.

39:01.833 --> 39:05.250
The New Testament says that God can
only understand the French language.

39:05.333 --> 39:07.000
And if I remember correctly,

39:07.083 --> 39:11.666
it says that God listens with love
to those who whisper in his ear in French.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.833
[chuckles softly]

39:13.916 --> 39:17.750
God is in love with the beauty
that he himself has envisioned.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.500
He is a vain artist.

39:21.083 --> 39:23.500
An artist that created woman…

39:24.416 --> 39:26.125
to be perfect.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.375
That's beautifully said.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.208
Yes.

39:32.791 --> 39:33.958
Very beautiful.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.958
-[door creaking]
-[wind whistling]

39:39.041 --> 39:41.041
[ominous music continues]

39:57.125 --> 39:59.166
-[in English] Thank you.
-Yes, of course.

40:00.250 --> 40:01.541
Make yourself at home.

40:05.958 --> 40:07.083
With your permission.

40:33.791 --> 40:35.791
[ominous music rises]

40:44.708 --> 40:46.875
[music fades out]

40:46.958 --> 40:48.416
[Carmen] It would be a possession.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.958
It's like being permanently pregnant
with the enemy of our Lord.

40:51.041 --> 40:52.083
Yes, but…

40:53.083 --> 40:55.583
you think the devil got inside his body?

40:55.666 --> 40:56.541
-Yeah
-How?

40:56.625 --> 40:57.500
It got in.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.875
Sometimes the devil comes in
through a wound in the skin.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.625
It happens to soldiers
in the battle, for example.

41:02.708 --> 41:05.458
Other times, the devil enters the body…
in the anus.

41:05.541 --> 41:08.958
-When a man practices, uh… sodomy.
-Watch your mouth, you.

41:09.708 --> 41:13.041
Papa was always a patriot soldier,
let me tell you that.

41:13.125 --> 41:16.791
Of course. In his case,
it must have entered through a war wound.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.666
-Of course. Mm.
-Yes, of course.

41:20.375 --> 41:23.625
Listen, and if Papa was born this way?

41:24.125 --> 41:28.291
And what if he is a part
of a species of animal.

41:29.375 --> 41:30.625
So an animal from hell?

41:30.708 --> 41:32.916
Sure, like a man with no spirit.
Like a dog.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.708
Beasts live alongside us all.

41:34.791 --> 41:37.250
Devil's creatures with no soul.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.875
Just a black smoke in the chest region.

41:39.958 --> 41:43.166
And beasts like that cannot be saved.
They simply have to be killed.

41:43.250 --> 41:45.125
I don't want Papa to suffer.

41:45.208 --> 41:47.333
Honestly, the battle will be so fierce.

41:47.416 --> 41:50.458
Satan's pathetic and melodramatic
and also relentless.

41:50.541 --> 41:53.625
If I run out of strength,
he could end up killing me.

41:53.708 --> 41:55.041
I don't really care.

41:55.125 --> 41:56.416
-Ah.
-No, just kidding.

41:56.500 --> 41:57.458
[chuckles]

41:57.541 --> 41:59.041
-Darling?
-Huh?

41:59.125 --> 42:02.125
My papa, you will treat him with love.

42:02.708 --> 42:04.250
-Violence is for the devil.
-Mm-hm.

42:04.333 --> 42:05.875
With God's love, he'll be asphyxiated.

42:05.958 --> 42:08.083
The holy water will burn him.

42:08.166 --> 42:12.000
And when the invader flees in humiliation,
your father will be at death's door.

42:12.083 --> 42:13.583
He will be bedridden.

42:13.666 --> 42:16.750
If he's a survivor, it means
that he has always had a soul

42:16.833 --> 42:19.083
And if only a portion
of good soul is there,

42:19.166 --> 42:22.250
that little bit,
it belongs to the Holy Spirit.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.791
-And you will see me save it.
-[chuckles]

42:24.875 --> 42:27.208
[suspenseful music playing]

42:30.083 --> 42:32.083
[camera whirring]

42:40.208 --> 42:42.208
[camera whirring]

42:50.083 --> 42:52.083
[camera whirring]

43:00.041 --> 43:02.750
[thunder rumbling]

43:06.375 --> 43:07.875
[music fades out]

43:09.500 --> 43:13.250
[Carmen] This printed record talks
about 12 apartments.

43:13.333 --> 43:15.833
This kind of investment
provides a passive income,

43:15.916 --> 43:18.791
and is very common in
families that don't want to work.

43:19.791 --> 43:21.666
There… There are 14.

43:21.750 --> 43:22.875
Fourteen?

43:22.958 --> 43:25.416
-The property records, they're not here.
-[daughter 3] What?

43:26.541 --> 43:29.791
-But how can properties just disappear?
-[daughter 1] Please. It's a minor thing.

43:29.875 --> 43:31.833
Twelve, fourteen, it's the same.

43:31.916 --> 43:33.958
No, "please." It needs to be clarified.

43:34.041 --> 43:36.083
We are talking about my money.

43:36.166 --> 43:38.000
-Your money?
-Yes, my money.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.416
Just shut up for a bit and let her work.

43:41.666 --> 43:42.958
Am I bothering you?

43:43.458 --> 43:45.916
No. I'm never bothered.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.500
Actually, I love seeing
blatant envy and violence.

43:48.583 --> 43:53.083
Because this irrationality is
what allows you to betray each other.

43:53.583 --> 43:55.666
My method is to foster confusion,

43:55.750 --> 43:59.083
because confusion,
leads to betrayal and lies.

43:59.166 --> 44:01.416
-And so you're not bothered?
-Mm-mm.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.500
I'm bothered,
I'm trying to work here, you know.

44:03.583 --> 44:05.750
What's this operation called CEMA Chile?

44:05.833 --> 44:08.250
The Mothers of Chile Center,
it's right there.

44:08.958 --> 44:09.833
ESTATE SUMMARY

44:09.916 --> 44:12.625
You derived money as the
Commander in Chief of the Army,

44:12.708 --> 44:14.083
from the payment of commissions

44:14.166 --> 44:17.041
for the sale of weapons and
supplies to CEMA Chile, right?

44:17.708 --> 44:18.708
Mama?

44:20.250 --> 44:22.833
There are no accounting documents.

44:22.916 --> 44:26.583
But this says the head of CEMA was
the president's wife, which means you.

44:26.666 --> 44:30.458
There were also reserved funds transferred
from the attaché offices and embassies

44:30.541 --> 44:32.708
from the Military Chiefs to CEMA Chile.

44:33.750 --> 44:37.500
It's so good that they appeared,
those papers, no?

44:37.583 --> 44:38.916
[daughter 1] I don't understand.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.500
Are we discussing
your inheritance here, Mama?

44:41.583 --> 44:44.375
-I'm not dead yet, darling.
-No, but you're almost there.

44:44.458 --> 44:47.125
It's just layers, and layers
upon layers of lies, Mama.

44:47.208 --> 44:50.291
Well, those layers and layers of lies
are making you a millionaire now.

44:50.375 --> 44:52.958
Well, we need to fix this,
if he's going to die.

44:54.583 --> 44:57.208
Well, I don't know what
you're squabbling about, to be honest.

44:57.791 --> 45:01.541
Everything that comes up, I'm pass…
passing on to you immediately,

45:01.625 --> 45:02.750
like the house in the snow.

45:02.833 --> 45:04.708
-[daughter 3] What house?
-In La Parva?

45:04.791 --> 45:06.208
No, Aspen.

45:06.708 --> 45:08.208
United States?

45:08.291 --> 45:10.916
No, no.
It's a refuge Papa transferred to me,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.666
because you've never been
interested in skiing.

45:13.750 --> 45:15.291
I'd like to learn to ski.

45:15.375 --> 45:17.333
And Papa wants to give us equal parts.

45:17.416 --> 45:20.666
Well, but this he gave to me,
just me and no one else but me.

45:20.750 --> 45:22.833
I'm outraged by this injustice.

45:25.583 --> 45:26.833
[camera whirring]

45:32.541 --> 45:34.666
I've been studying your judicial case,

45:34.750 --> 45:37.541
and after examining those filthy slanders,

45:37.625 --> 45:39.583
can you imagine, it says that you ordered

45:39.666 --> 45:41.916
the murder and disappearance
of thousands of Chileans.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.208
-Oh?
-Yes.

45:43.291 --> 45:46.750
There is also evidence
against you regarding secret documents

45:46.833 --> 45:48.000
and ill-gotten wealth.

45:48.583 --> 45:50.125
That is why I've come to the conclusion

45:50.208 --> 45:52.875
that you have other assets
held in other countries.

45:52.958 --> 45:55.291
Yes, yes. That's why I had to die.

45:55.375 --> 45:57.166
She wanted to get hold of them.

45:57.250 --> 45:59.916
Sure. But you didn't die
when they said you died, did you?

46:00.500 --> 46:02.666
In fact, I look at you now,
and paradoxically,

46:02.750 --> 46:05.291
you are breathing fiercely,
like a bull in spring.

46:05.375 --> 46:07.875
-[inhales deeply] Ah, yes?
-Yes.

46:07.958 --> 46:09.000
What a thing.

46:09.083 --> 46:10.875
And could you explain in detail

46:10.958 --> 46:13.333
the finance companies
where those secret accounts are?

46:13.416 --> 46:15.166
Of course! I had to take the money out

46:15.250 --> 46:17.416
because my children
don't know how to work,

46:17.500 --> 46:19.458
and I didn't want them to starve to death.

46:19.541 --> 46:20.416
Right…

46:20.500 --> 46:22.625
-I don't want you to think I'm a thief.
-No, no, no, no.

46:22.708 --> 46:25.500
Thieves steal what belongs to others.

46:25.583 --> 46:27.875
-You use your power to enrich yourself.
-That's it.

46:27.958 --> 46:29.666
That of course is the only way to do it.

46:29.750 --> 46:32.083
I was a reserved general.

46:32.166 --> 46:33.708
An intellectual.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.583
Until a person came that convinced me

46:35.666 --> 46:38.750
that I had to make a military coup
to get rid of the government

46:38.833 --> 46:40.958
of that Marxist-Leninist Allende.

46:41.041 --> 46:46.541
And then, I was surrounded
by gentlemen so elegant with cologne.

46:46.625 --> 46:49.791
Until someone came,
very elegant as well,

46:49.875 --> 46:51.500
and offered me money.

46:52.458 --> 46:54.000
I didn't know what to do.

46:54.083 --> 46:55.666
He says, "What's more, don't worry."

46:55.750 --> 46:58.333
"I'll even open an account
for you in a Caribbean bank."

46:58.416 --> 46:59.833
"Okay," I said. I accepted.

46:59.916 --> 47:02.416
And a little bit later
he asked for a favor.

47:02.500 --> 47:06.416
He wanted to buy companies
owned by the state at a cheap price.

47:06.500 --> 47:11.833
I thought about it and realized that what
this man was doing was blackmailing me.

47:11.916 --> 47:14.916
And then they came
in droves to talk to me.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.750
And they offered me the moon
and then even more… Rich. I got it all.

47:19.958 --> 47:22.875
So much so that Lucía put a… a chandelier.

47:22.958 --> 47:25.541
Just hanging from the ceiling
in the bathroom.

47:25.625 --> 47:28.541
Aside from all that,
I became a star all around the world

47:28.625 --> 47:30.708
because I had defeated communism.

47:30.791 --> 47:31.958
It's such a scandal

47:32.041 --> 47:34.958
that you were the victim
of a manipulation so utterly horrible,

47:35.458 --> 47:39.416
and that unknowingly,
you were involved in influence peddling.

47:40.041 --> 47:43.708
Accidentally receiving secret payments
from soulless businessmen.

47:43.791 --> 47:47.791
Yes, that's true, that's true, I have
beyond all doubt been a victim here.

47:47.875 --> 47:49.750
However, I can't quite believe it.

47:49.833 --> 47:51.708
Because you are a captain general,

47:51.791 --> 47:55.208
you are a hero that should be more
intelligent than those simple businessmen.

47:55.291 --> 47:56.291
Right.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.916
And you never thought
to donate your fortune

47:59.000 --> 48:00.958
to the charities of the Catholic faith?

48:01.041 --> 48:05.541
[chuckling] If I did that,
my children would murder me.

48:05.625 --> 48:08.250
But isn't that what you desire?
To be killed?

48:08.750 --> 48:12.125
[hesitates] Well, yes,
it's just that, right now…

48:12.833 --> 48:15.583
Uh… I've decided, well…

48:15.666 --> 48:17.833
it would be good to live another life.

48:18.875 --> 48:22.958
Well, if that's your desire,
and you want to repeat the horror,

48:23.041 --> 48:25.875
then let's recover that fortune
that was lost in those papers.

48:25.958 --> 48:27.875
You make a good point.

48:29.250 --> 48:31.291
I want you to know
that my questions are personal

48:31.375 --> 48:33.458
because they are needed for my work.

48:33.541 --> 48:37.583
But I am also a curious person,
and I like to undress with my voice.

48:38.166 --> 48:40.416
That is fine. Magnificent.

48:40.500 --> 48:43.208
What are you planning to destroy
when you start again?

48:43.958 --> 48:46.958
Well, the International Court
in The Hague.

48:47.916 --> 48:50.166
And… I don't know.

48:50.250 --> 48:51.458
It's not important.

48:51.541 --> 48:56.208
I haven't decided yet because,
I tell you, I want to live.

48:56.291 --> 49:00.166
[British woman] There's nothing more
gruesome than watching a man fall in love.

49:00.666 --> 49:02.583
I hope you have been inspired
by my presence.

49:02.666 --> 49:03.625
Yes.

49:03.708 --> 49:06.125
[British woman] It's worse than
seeing a body without a heart.

49:06.208 --> 49:08.000
Men of sin have told me that my body

49:08.083 --> 49:10.875
has something that invites
a second opportunity.

49:10.958 --> 49:12.583
-What is that?
-No idea.

49:13.416 --> 49:15.750
Maybe I smell like paradise flowers.

49:16.791 --> 49:19.250
It could also be
a new hormone that changes…

49:19.333 --> 49:21.250
the acidic smell of my body.

49:22.166 --> 49:23.875
Oh, I'm not…

49:23.958 --> 49:25.000
[inhales deeply]

49:25.083 --> 49:27.833
Not quite able… able to smell you.

49:27.916 --> 49:30.375
[somber string music playing]

49:32.375 --> 49:34.750
[all munching loudly]

49:35.291 --> 49:36.166
[son 1] Mmm.

49:36.666 --> 49:37.750
[Carmen] Mm-hm.

49:53.750 --> 49:55.541
Papa isn't coming down to eat?

[British woman] This is old blood.

53:36.291 --> 53:38.875
Old hearts from old bodies.

53:41.041 --> 53:44.916
They can't give life
the way that fresh blood can.

53:49.916 --> 53:52.666
[whispering] Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

forgive those that trespass against us.

as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

54:35.041 --> 54:38.208
[voice breaking] And lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.

55:20.291 --> 55:21.416
Why not?

55:22.083 --> 55:23.958
I don't want to waste any time.

55:24.583 --> 55:26.416
I'm trying to help you die.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.333
You think I am pleased with your service?

55:29.916 --> 55:33.791
-Killing Reds? Anyone can do that.
-No, not anyone.

55:34.625 --> 55:38.000
I taught all of my soldiers
to kill for pleasure.

55:38.791 --> 55:41.625
And burning women's breasts
with electricity?

55:41.708 --> 55:43.125
Was that pleasure?

55:43.625 --> 55:45.166
With love, even.

55:45.750 --> 55:46.791
Pleasure.

55:47.416 --> 55:48.333
[laughs]

55:49.000 --> 55:52.666
And when I finally bit you,
you dropped your trousers.

55:52.750 --> 55:54.291
Why was that?

55:54.375 --> 55:56.333
Don't go out to hunt, my general.

55:56.833 --> 55:59.000
That woman, the accountant is a nun.

55:59.875 --> 56:02.625
That woman wants
to the get the devil out of me.

56:02.708 --> 56:03.916
But you know,

56:04.666 --> 56:06.291
I have nothing inside.

56:07.958 --> 56:10.416
[laughs] And neither do I.

56:10.500 --> 56:13.458
[laughs] We are both
creatures of the night.

56:13.541 --> 56:16.291
And the night is made
just for thieves like you, sir.

56:17.166 --> 56:19.083
I liked killing.

56:19.166 --> 56:21.166
And you always liked to steal.

56:21.250 --> 56:23.416
No, I liked killing as well.

56:24.333 --> 56:28.333
But I can't live
like a country peasant, Fyodor.

56:28.416 --> 56:31.458
No, I need to be standing in a rock,
in something made of cement.

56:31.541 --> 56:33.041
Something solid.

56:33.125 --> 56:36.458
I need people to help me.
I need servants like you.

56:36.541 --> 56:39.083
It bothers me washing dirty sheets.

56:40.791 --> 56:42.583
What do you mean, dirty sheets?

56:43.083 --> 56:46.291
The ones left by Lucía and you.

56:48.125 --> 56:49.708
But I've never touched her.

56:49.791 --> 56:51.291
[ominous music playing]

56:51.375 --> 56:52.500
Not yet?

56:53.375 --> 56:54.375
No.

56:54.458 --> 56:56.625
Fine, touch her now. Touch her.

56:56.708 --> 57:00.208
But above all,
don't do those howls of pleasure.

57:01.208 --> 57:03.291
No, that is so feminine.

57:04.750 --> 57:06.125
I'll give you my wife.

57:06.208 --> 57:07.708
You can keep her.

57:08.500 --> 57:10.833
You can do whatever you want with her.

57:10.916 --> 57:13.708
But the money, it's mine.

[orchestral music fades]

58:37.458 --> 58:41.083
You and your brothers and sisters were
in prison in 2007 for embezzlement--

58:41.166 --> 58:42.875
We were political prisoners.

58:43.375 --> 58:46.083
Of course, but you were
also accused of hitting--

58:46.166 --> 58:48.083
How do you intend to do this exorcism?

58:50.083 --> 58:51.208
With God's love.

58:51.291 --> 58:53.208
But what if you don't get the demon out?

58:53.291 --> 58:55.083
That depends on the will
of the Holy Spirit.

58:55.166 --> 58:56.083
Enough with that.

58:56.166 --> 58:59.333
If you don't manage to get the devil out
of my papa, what will you do with him?

58:59.416 --> 59:01.125
I can kill him with a plastic bag,
you know.

59:01.208 --> 59:04.416
-What do you mean?
-I put a bag on his head, he's gone.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.208
-I cut--
-The genitals?

59:06.291 --> 59:08.333
-Not necessary.
-Cut it all.

59:08.833 --> 59:11.208
Did you know that there were
secret documents,

59:11.291 --> 59:13.458
vouchers and various bearer bonds?

59:13.541 --> 59:15.000
-Yes?
-Yes.

59:15.083 --> 59:17.083
And why didn't you come
looking for them before,

59:17.166 --> 59:20.416
during all these years in which
your father has been the living dead?

59:21.250 --> 59:25.416
Because as you said, those leftist judges
have continued to investigate us.

59:25.500 --> 59:28.208
So it wasn't wise to go
looking for unreported money.

59:28.875 --> 59:32.625
In any case, my mama figured out
how to continue receiving donations.

59:33.250 --> 59:35.958
And some of that charity
got through to us.

to feed on the heart of an older woman.

01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:12.291
After the attack on the
Twin Towers in the year 2001,

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:15.875
the senate of the United States
required several financial entities

01:00:15.958 --> 01:00:18.000
to lift banking privacy
so they could investigate

01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:20.458
how the finances of terrorism worked.

01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:21.916
Fucking gringos.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.833
Accidentally,
they looked into your family,

01:00:24.916 --> 01:00:26.708
and the accounts
with all those fake names.

01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:30.125
Then they put Osama Bin Laden's
picture next to your father's.

01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:31.333
[both laughing]

01:00:31.416 --> 01:00:32.916
How many accounts were there?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.291
A hundred and twenty-five
in the United States, maybe.

01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:36.208
Maybe?

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:39.250
Those are the accounts the judge saw,
but he didn't investigate very well.

01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:44.000
He didn't see what was in Germany,
the Bahamas, or Gibraltar, for example.

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:46.458
[Carmen] Your father used,
among others, the criminal alias

01:00:46.541 --> 01:00:49.166
"Daniel López" to hide
his many illegal acts.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.583
Are you aware of why
he chose such a normal name?

01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:53.458
It isn't a criminal alias, you know.
It isn't!

01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:56.416
Well, it's not exactly an artistic name.
It's a nom de guerre.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.958
But for a war against the law

01:00:58.041 --> 01:01:00.416
that protects the Republic
from financial crimes.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.125
He used it only to make, um…

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:06.291
So he could have… So he could have
the income that matched the fortunes

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:09.208
of the hundreds of businessmen
that he helped become millionaires.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:10.958
Then it was an illegal and ordinary name

01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:13.416
that was created for a goal
that was absolutely noble.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.666
Well, it may be illegal…

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:18.291
according to the laws
of this ungrateful country,

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:21.500
but it was in fact a wholly blessed act
in the face of divine justice.

01:01:23.583 --> 01:01:26.500
[machines whirring and clanging]

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.250
The thing is that Papa
was a martial arts expert.

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:41.916
And he could stop his breath
for ten minutes.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.583
-At least.
-At least?

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.875
-His pulse as well.
-Ah.

01:01:45.958 --> 01:01:50.208
So when it was Mama's birthday celebration
and he had that failure,

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:55.000
the doctors came immediately,
took his vitals and declared him dead.

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:58.291
He could probably do
the same thing once more.

01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:01.541
No. No, because now
he wants to die for real.

01:02:01.625 --> 01:02:03.708
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

[choking]

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:14.625
Maybe that was the name of
a distant relative, I'm just guessing.

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:16.458
Or instead, in the 1980s,

01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:19.375
the captain general first killed,
and then burned,

01:02:19.458 --> 01:02:21.208
and then threw into the sea
from a helicopter

01:02:21.291 --> 01:02:23.291
the charred body of Daniel López.

01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:25.166
Papa isn't capable of killing anyone!

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:27.541
No, of course.
His subordinates were the ones

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:30.250
that committed
those heinous acts of violence.

01:02:30.333 --> 01:02:33.291
But I am talking about
your papa's strange sense of humor.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.375
Because maybe the captain general

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:39.583
could have used the name of one of those
disappeared detainees to… To swindle.

01:02:39.666 --> 01:02:42.625
To make a bitter joke that only
the true killers of this Daniel López

01:02:42.708 --> 01:02:44.208
could possibly understand.

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:48.250
But that is impossible because my papa
has no sense of humor. He doesn't have it.

01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:51.833
-[dramatic orchestral music rises]

[music ends]

01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:05.500

-[Carmen] Yes, yes.

01:03:05.583 --> 01:03:07.291
[wind whistling]

01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:09.375
So you believe in God?

01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:11.500
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:13.541
I went to
a very traditional Catholic school.

01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:16.125
When Franco died
three nuns committed suicide.

01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:18.125
Why does God almighty
allow the devil to live

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:20.250
when he could have killed him already, no?

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:23.333
It's a sublime mystery,
but we resign ourselves to the Lord,

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:26.500
and we say that with love we don't mind
living in ignorance of his motivations,

01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:29.791
because one day we will live in
the bristling bosom of his love.

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:31.458
-Is that clear?
-Yes, it's clear.

01:03:32.458 --> 01:03:34.541
But what happens
if I have the devil in my soul?

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:37.333
Because I like whiskey, men,
cars and expensive things.

01:03:38.458 --> 01:03:41.833
-Is that the devil?
-That is definitely a call from Satan.

01:03:41.916 --> 01:03:43.708
And what's God giving?

01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:45.458
Pure sanctified love.

01:03:45.541 --> 01:03:48.958
My desire is to one day
look my holy Lord in the eye…

01:03:49.875 --> 01:03:50.916
What a load of shit.

01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:55.250
I'm sure that God sends us into
the world to see if we are with the devil.

01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:59.250
I was tempted, and did it all,
lust was always a big thing for me.

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.666
I'm dirty.

01:04:01.208 --> 01:04:02.291
Very dirty.

01:04:04.416 --> 01:04:06.166
-Hm.
-Sorry.

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:09.458
No. Don't worry.
I agree with what you say.

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:12.333
In fact, I came to this world
to meet the devil.

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:13.916
That we can live together.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.208
Give him love.

01:04:15.291 --> 01:04:16.833
To be tempted.

01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.500
To be caressed.

01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:20.541
To caress him as well.

01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:22.208
To humiliate.

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:24.125
Make the devil see God's way.

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:29.375
[British woman] Nothing is more nutritious
than the heart of a young woman.

01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:31.625
It contains certain hormones,
a certain chemical

01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:34.583
that fires up
the blood of the eternal man.

01:04:35.083 --> 01:04:37.791
This latest victim is certainly not that.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:41.166
But the count is behaving erratically.

01:04:42.416 --> 01:04:45.166
You do know that
your sister told me it all?

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:46.458
It all?

01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:47.750
Your sister called me to come

01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:51.000
and save the heart
and seething soul of your father.

01:04:51.083 --> 01:04:52.625
An overburdened soul.

01:04:53.458 --> 01:04:57.291
That is exactly what we've been
begging for such a long time.

01:04:57.375 --> 01:05:00.916
All generals that conquer
have the absolute right to ransack,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.666
and to keep a fortune!

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.041
Absolutely.

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:07.458
And it's very sad to see that his heirs,
like you,

01:05:07.541 --> 01:05:09.500
cannot share the honor of his glory.

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:11.583
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:14.583
-[blood splashing]
-[slurping]

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:25.000
The undefeated Chilean army allowed
your father to use it to launder money.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.208
If you think of it that way, maybe.

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:28.958
But look, many years ago

01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:32.083
I managed to purchase a steel company
from the army.

01:05:32.583 --> 01:05:34.208
And it was cheap. Extremely cheap.

01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:35.791
Because it was bankrupt.

01:05:35.875 --> 01:05:37.791
And a few years after that,

01:05:37.875 --> 01:05:40.625
I sold that company back to the same army,

01:05:40.708 --> 01:05:43.291
but now for three million dollars.
That makes like…

01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:44.458
How much is that?

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:45.833
1,000% profit?

01:05:45.916 --> 01:05:48.583
I don't know the exact number
because I was never good at mathematics.

01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:51.208
[chuckling] And did you
get it out of bankruptcy?

01:05:51.291 --> 01:05:53.958
No, no, no. It was bankrupt.
I did nothing.

01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:57.875
So the Chilean army, they went and
bought a totally bankrupt steel company

01:05:57.958 --> 01:06:00.125
using your father's checks.

01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:01.333
That's right.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.416
And, then,
you deposited those three checks

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.916
that added up to three million dollars

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.708
in secret bank accounts
in Washington using pseudonyms.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:11.750
Simple.

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:14.125
-Simple.
-But nobody ever knew.

01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:16.875
So when people came forward,
I wasn't investigated.

01:06:16.958 --> 01:06:19.041
We continued to live as normal.

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:21.791
-Free and happy.
-Excuse me, sir.

01:06:21.875 --> 01:06:24.875
You are free because your father
threatened to stage a new coup

01:06:24.958 --> 01:06:26.000
if you were investigated.

01:06:26.083 --> 01:06:29.416
Yes, but every Christian Democrat
from that time was in agreement.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.291
And if it worked, it worked.

01:06:31.791 --> 01:06:34.458
Three million dollars in personal checks.

01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:36.958
-Three million dollars.
-Sounds a lot.

01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:39.333
But put into perspective,
it's insignificant.

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:43.458
Compare it to Fulgencio Batista
or Ferdinand Marcos. Huh?

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:46.291
After those guys our fortune's,
well, laughable.

01:06:46.791 --> 01:06:49.375
Now they were corrupt.
And murderers as well.

01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:52.208
[chuckles softly]
Your simple-mindedness is fascinating.

01:06:52.291 --> 01:06:54.333
"My father stole less
than these other robbers."

01:06:54.416 --> 01:06:56.250
It's only a villain
that can say those words.

01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:58.958
An empty being that doesn't
believe in the human experience.

01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:00.250
Why, thank you.

01:07:00.791 --> 01:07:02.125
[camera whirring]

01:07:04.208 --> 01:07:06.291
Are there any more hidden
documents in this house?

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:07.291
No.

01:07:08.875 --> 01:07:10.833
So how did these documents get here?

01:07:10.916 --> 01:07:13.250
-Do you remember that?
-They were brought here.

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:16.375
Apparently by helicopter,
but not while I was here.

01:07:16.875 --> 01:07:18.875
And so you hid them in the cellar,
didn't you?

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:19.958
Possibly.

-It must be a horrible sacrifice.
-It must be so…

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:35.833
Besides, can you imagine the humiliation
of having to hide all that money

01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:37.333
to live a life that never ends?

01:07:37.416 --> 01:07:38.875
[son 1] But where is that money?

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:41.375
[Carmen] I'm finding everything out.
But tell me.

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:43.333
-Are there accounts in Panama?
-Yes.

01:07:43.416 --> 01:07:44.708
-Yes.
-Six.

01:07:47.458 --> 01:07:48.458
Seven.

01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:51.958
And right now you can move money
between these accounts?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.333
It's not possible.

01:07:56.916 --> 01:07:59.458
[son 2] We bought old books,
collector's items.

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:01.791

Strange.

-You knew that?
-No, I didn't know. [chuckles softly]

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:10.250
My Papa stored a mountain of junk.

01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:12.250
He had Napoleon's hat,

01:08:12.333 --> 01:08:14.375
a sword from O'Higgins,

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:16.750
and a dress from, uh… [clicks tongue]

01:08:16.832 --> 01:08:18.750
…some queen they had in France.

01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:22.041
[somber string music playing]

01:08:34.041 --> 01:08:35.125
Last question.

01:08:35.207 --> 01:08:36.957
So Fyodor, the butler…

01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:38.832
He also eats blood.

01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:40.416
A white Russian.

01:08:41.166 --> 01:08:42.957
He killed many Bolsheviks. Many.

01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:44.916
Of course, the Bolsheviks of this country.

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:49.375
As revenge for the Russian
Revolution that exiled his family.

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:52.291
Here, he was a master of torture.

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:55.041
And my father bit him in the leg
to thank him for his services

01:08:55.125 --> 01:08:56.582
and give him eternal life.

01:08:57.791 --> 01:09:00.000
But you may already know that…

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:01.457
that butler is a brute.

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:04.082
He has only one testicle, like Hitler.

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:05.791
He can't eat normal food.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:08.125
If there's no meat, it's human excrement.

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.457
He also eats animal excrement.

01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:13.416
That's why he licks
the anus of shepherd dogs.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.832
You haven't seen him?

01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:16.791
No.

01:09:17.791 --> 01:09:18.750
Not yet.

01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:23.750

over 300 political prisoners.

-Are you proud?
-I declare that I'm absolutely innocent.

01:09:27.582 --> 01:09:30.707
You are sentenced to 865 years in prison.

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:33.207
I don't understand how you are here.

01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:36.875

your same name and your same appearance

01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:39.666

[dramatic music rises]

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:49.791
The Chilean army, it taught me
torture was of the utmost importance.

01:09:50.375 --> 01:09:53.875
I simply stuck to following
the instructions that were given to me.

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:58.416

by teachers paid by the state of Chile.

01:10:03.333 --> 01:10:05.958

01:10:06.708 --> 01:10:07.541
What?

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.416
When torturing someone,
it's more efficient,

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.208
the promise of it all,
than the torture itself.

01:10:13.291 --> 01:10:18.583

as the imagination is able to run wild.

[cape fluttering]

01:23:28.291 --> 01:23:32.333
[British woman] It's time
for me to head south once again.

01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:38.625
Because it's not the first war
I've fought in this hemisphere.

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:44.125
This time I have to
because our dear count has crossed a line.

01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:46.791
Call me a conservative,

01:23:46.875 --> 01:23:50.791
but this puerile intimacy
shall not be allowed.

01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:56.708
I thought I was going to be able
to tell this story from my chambers.

01:23:56.791 --> 01:23:59.666
But now there is no alternative.

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:03.750
[son 1] With these documents
and this money,

01:24:03.833 --> 01:24:07.375
the Church could blackmail
the Chilean army, the state of Chile,

01:24:07.458 --> 01:24:10.500
and also the businessmen
who nobly donated their money,

01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:13.583
jewelry and cash to help Mother Lucía.

01:24:13.666 --> 01:24:15.583
But Carmen is a child.

01:24:16.458 --> 01:24:17.583
A little bitch.

01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:19.625
She has a perfect mind.

01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:21.958
Beautiful and criminal.

01:24:23.375 --> 01:24:24.958
She's even better than I am.

01:24:25.041 --> 01:24:26.791
She came to steal.

01:24:27.708 --> 01:24:28.750
Bitch.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:31.500
-Whore.
-I told her everything.

01:24:32.416 --> 01:24:34.500
-She's gonna steal it.
-No.

01:24:34.583 --> 01:24:36.916
-She'll steal it all.
-That is not what he is saying.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.541
-I think she's gonna blackmail us.
-[daughter 3] No, you idiot.

01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:43.166
She's going to steal,
humiliate us, and blackmail the others.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:46.458
-[son 1] And that was the only copy?
-[daughter 1] We have to check her room.

01:24:46.541 --> 01:24:48.750
[son 1] The money. Where's the money?

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:50.583
[son 2] Did someone get in her suitcase?

01:24:50.666 --> 01:24:52.708
Mm. She will kill him.

01:24:52.791 --> 01:24:55.166
-The nun will kill him?
-And then they're going to blame me.

01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:57.166
She brought stakes and silver hammers.

01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:59.625
-And holy water and some bits of rope.
-She what?

01:24:59.708 --> 01:25:01.666
She brought stakes and silver hammers!

01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:03.833
-Are you deaf?
-She won't kill me.

01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:05.375
She won't kill me.

01:25:05.458 --> 01:25:08.000
I already went down once,
I won't go down again.

01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:11.500
-And Mama? Where is she?
-She's fine, with Fyodor.

01:25:11.583 --> 01:25:15.708
She won't kill me either.
I won't let a little girl kill me.

01:25:17.291 --> 01:25:18.375
You have to kill her.

01:25:18.458 --> 01:25:20.875
I can't. My general would kill me first.

01:25:21.541 --> 01:25:23.625
You're more loyal
to the general than to me?

01:25:23.708 --> 01:25:25.125
Let me bite you.

01:25:25.208 --> 01:25:27.625
-No.
-Now, let me bite you right now.

01:25:27.708 --> 01:25:29.583
I am the royal queen.

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:31.750
Stop fooling around.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.708
I am a foreigner to this century.

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.375
And to you I am life eternal.

01:25:41.125 --> 01:25:44.916
If you're gonna bite me,
I want you to kill the general first.

01:25:50.125 --> 01:25:51.208
With your permission.

01:25:55.333 --> 01:25:57.708
I want you to win a war for--

01:25:57.791 --> 01:25:59.875
[straining]

01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:01.458
Ooh! Get…

01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:05.833
[groaning]

01:26:05.916 --> 01:26:08.333
[intriguing orchestral music playing]

01:26:30.458 --> 01:26:31.458
Margaret?

01:26:34.958 --> 01:26:36.791
Who's the lucky lady?

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.333
Um. Don't know. I have no idea.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.375
I just met her. I only met her today.

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:45.333
Get dressed.

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:51.125
A pleasure to see you.
I thought you were dead,

01:26:51.208 --> 01:26:53.625
but, like me,
there are still other ancient people.

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:55.416
Why did you bite her?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.583
Well, because
she's the flavor of the hour.

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.958
I am your love, Count.

01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:05.625
Your oldest love.

01:27:06.583 --> 01:27:08.958
Many years ago,
I was an English seasonal worker

01:27:09.041 --> 01:27:10.791
in the vineyards of southern France.

01:27:13.416 --> 01:27:16.750
It was a hard life,
but I didn't starve to death.

01:27:19.416 --> 01:27:22.583
Sometimes
the sailors landing at Marseilles,

01:27:22.666 --> 01:27:25.166
would venture into the fields
to let off steam

01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:28.958
with the peasant girls they'd find
among the onions or the grapes.

01:27:29.791 --> 01:27:31.291
They were ferocious men.

01:27:35.791 --> 01:27:38.125
He raped me, of course.

01:27:38.208 --> 01:27:40.458
But oddly, he was most interested

01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:42.250
in my neck.

01:27:42.875 --> 01:27:47.291
As he committed his crime,
he told me his name over and over again.

01:27:47.375 --> 01:27:49.125
-Strigoi.
-[sucking]

01:27:49.208 --> 01:27:50.416
[Margaret] Strigoi.

01:27:51.458 --> 01:27:53.708
He said he was a trafficker of slaves.

01:27:53.791 --> 01:27:57.666
-That I would be his slave forever.
-["Cold Song" playing]

01:27:57.750 --> 01:28:04.166
A few months later, I realized Strigoi
had turned me into a vampire.

01:28:04.666 --> 01:28:07.333
And had left me with child.

01:28:09.791 --> 01:28:13.750
Luckily, Strigoi returned
to the vineyard whenever he could.

01:28:13.833 --> 01:28:17.416
I had to see him again
to thank him for what he'd done for me.

01:28:19.208 --> 01:28:22.083
-[grunting]
-[gasping]

01:28:23.375 --> 01:28:25.041
[rasping breath]

01:28:25.875 --> 01:28:29.375
[Margaret] From that romantic liaison,
a beautiful child was born.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.750
Whom I could not take care of.

01:28:33.916 --> 01:28:38.916
On February 25, 1766,
you emerged from my belly.

01:28:40.625 --> 01:28:42.625
In the basket, I left you

01:28:43.125 --> 01:28:44.875
a note with your name.

01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.625
[baby fusses]

01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:55.625
[Margaret] I, Margaret Roberts,
the fallen peasant girl, lived many lives.

01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:58.041
I crossed the Channel to Great Britain.

01:28:58.541 --> 01:29:03.208
And in 1951,
married Denis Thatcher, taking his name.

01:29:03.958 --> 01:29:06.291
They called me the Iron Lady.

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:09.416
The unrelenting Margaret Thatcher.

01:29:10.083 --> 01:29:12.875
You never knew who your mother was.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.791
And I never heard word of you,

01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:20.250
though I searched for two centuries.

01:29:21.916 --> 01:29:23.250
In the Falklands War,

01:29:23.833 --> 01:29:26.750
you decided to help us,
not knowing that I,

01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:30.125
your mother, was the prime minister.

01:29:30.208 --> 01:29:32.666
Years later, that horrid Spanish judge

01:29:32.750 --> 01:29:35.416
took out an international warrant
against you

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:39.458
for some human rights business,
and you were arrested in London.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.041
And when I visited you in Virginia Waters

01:29:42.125 --> 01:29:44.916
to thank you
for what you'd done for England,

01:29:45.458 --> 01:29:48.583
I recognized you, but I didn't say a word.

01:29:48.666 --> 01:29:50.875
[chilling bass aria rising]

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:56.666
The message is simple.
The general must be freed.

01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:59.125
He was a staunch friend of Britain.

01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:02.333
A dear ally who supported us
throughout the Falklands War.

01:30:02.416 --> 01:30:06.583
He supplied valuable military intelligence
against the Argentine enemy.

01:30:06.666 --> 01:30:10.500
Pinochet should be tried in Chile,
not in England.

01:30:11.875 --> 01:30:13.375
You are the son

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:16.541
of the vampire Strigoi.

01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:19.875
And I am the love of your life.

01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:23.041
And now we shall begin our life together.

01:30:23.125 --> 01:30:26.750
But first, you must eliminate her.

01:30:32.166 --> 01:30:34.000
[music ends]

01:30:34.083 --> 01:30:35.000
No.

01:30:38.208 --> 01:30:42.666
I allowed this trollop from the Church
to bring back your lust for life.

01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:45.541
It was effective and very moving,

01:30:46.041 --> 01:30:49.250
but now she must die,
and you are going to kill her.

01:30:50.958 --> 01:30:54.708
Don't worry. No one understands
the love between a mother and son.

01:30:59.083 --> 01:31:00.250
Lucía.

01:31:01.208 --> 01:31:03.791
You motherfucking old bitch.

01:31:04.291 --> 01:31:06.916
I always knew you
wanted to steal my husband.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.291
Don't speak to me like that,
indigenous woman.

01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:11.583
And I don't want to steal him. He's mine.

01:31:14.166 --> 01:31:15.916
What? You bit her?

01:31:16.583 --> 01:31:20.416
You've only just met this little thief,
and you've bitten her already!

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.916
Oh, don't be an old nag!

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.166
You reek of Fyodor.
I can smell him from over here.

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:26.166
Traitor.

01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:28.333
[daughter 1] Then Mama
will never die either.

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:29.958
[daughter 3] And now Carmencita.

01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:32.500
We're screwed. We're left with nothing.

01:31:32.583 --> 01:31:33.791
[daughter 3] What?

01:31:33.875 --> 01:31:36.375
If Papa doesn't die,
we won't get anything.

01:31:36.458 --> 01:31:37.916
And if they kill each other?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.208
-Why would they kill each other?
-For the money?

01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:43.000
No, 'cause they love and hate each other.
They're not of our species.

01:31:43.083 --> 01:31:44.458
[Margaret] A superior species.

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:46.875
-We'll just have to kill them.
-[melancholy music playing]

01:31:46.958 --> 01:31:48.833
You'll kill four vampires?

01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:51.166
I'm not gonna kill Mama.

01:31:58.666 --> 01:32:01.166

[dramatic string music playing]

01:33:26.458 --> 01:33:30.583
[Margaret] The count's secret boudoir
is a place of pure nostalgia.

01:33:31.208 --> 01:33:34.250
A ridiculous
reconstruction of royal life in France,

01:33:34.333 --> 01:33:36.500
before the revolutionary terror.

01:33:38.250 --> 01:33:39.958
It's his time machine.

01:33:47.125 --> 01:33:49.708
And now Carmen is his queen, dressed as

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:51.291
-Marie Antoinette.
-Marie Antoinette.

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:52.916
She's yours now.

01:33:55.916 --> 01:34:00.500
Just like all men, my son is an idiot
who never could understand women.

[music ends abruptly]

01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:03.875
[Margaret] He loved many
and burned several

01:34:03.958 --> 01:34:08.458
but never had the wit to read
such a glaringly obvious plan.

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:15.916
You old horror!

01:34:16.625 --> 01:34:18.083
Penniless old man.

01:34:18.666 --> 01:34:20.416
You loveless old man!

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:21.666
What a pain.

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:23.666
You don't know about victory.

01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:26.750
It's true that beauty
and intelligence never go together.

01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:31.666
The end of this ridiculous affair.

01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:38.125
-[glass shattering]
-[dramatic music playing]

01:35:01.958 --> 01:35:03.958
[door creaking]

01:35:26.541 --> 01:35:28.083
-[gasping]
-[blade drawing]

01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:30.750
-[blood splashing]
-[Fyodor gasping]

01:35:34.458 --> 01:35:35.541
[body thuds]

01:35:41.375 --> 01:35:43.375
[panting]

01:35:56.083 --> 01:36:00.041
[Margaret] She sacrificed her life
to do the bidding of the Holy Spirit.

01:36:00.125 --> 01:36:02.583
A perfect religious fanatic.

01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:05.458
Our Church needs to be reborn.

01:36:05.541 --> 01:36:07.666
Just like our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:36:08.166 --> 01:36:09.333
Amen, Monsignor.

01:36:09.833 --> 01:36:14.333
Once you are finished with the report,
you will have to defeat Satan.

01:36:15.083 --> 01:36:16.875
And kill the vampire.

01:36:17.583 --> 01:36:21.458
And if you find any document
signed to the bearer,

01:36:21.541 --> 01:36:23.958
that may be of use to the Church,

01:36:24.041 --> 01:36:25.083
take it.

01:36:25.166 --> 01:36:29.416
Banks, account numbers, companies,
documents signed by important people,

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.958
Ministers, businessmen, whatever.

01:36:32.041 --> 01:36:33.250
Let them talk.

01:36:42.333 --> 01:36:44.333
[dramatic music continues]

01:36:55.791 --> 01:36:57.500
[gasping]

01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:08.791
[dramatic music rises]

01:37:26.958 --> 01:37:29.708
[Carmen gasping and crying]

01:37:33.083 --> 01:37:34.500
[screams]

01:37:34.583 --> 01:37:36.250
-[squelching]
-[head thumps]

01:37:37.708 --> 01:37:39.708
[somber string music playing]

01:37:43.291 --> 01:37:44.500
[sighs deeply]

01:37:54.291 --> 01:37:56.833
[dramatic string music playing]

01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:07.166
[agonized moaning]

01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:09.250
[wet sawing]

01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:12.125
[moaning continues]

01:38:24.041 --> 01:38:24.958
Right.

01:38:40.458 --> 01:38:42.416
-[fire crackling]
-[straining]

01:38:52.083 --> 01:38:53.416
[grunting]

01:39:01.875 --> 01:39:03.125
[dramatic music ends]

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:16.500
[sighs] Well, shall we?

01:39:17.833 --> 01:39:18.833
Papa?

01:39:19.541 --> 01:39:20.541
Papa!

01:39:21.875 --> 01:39:24.541
[inhales deeply] What a pain.

01:39:25.333 --> 01:39:26.375
Let's go.

01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:28.291
[daughter 1] Papa?

01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:32.291
Papa?

01:39:39.958 --> 01:39:43.666
[Margaret] The pack of philistines
who came to plunder this place

01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:46.166
never knew that the true treasure
of this house

01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:50.625
was always the books that my son
collected throughout his long life.

01:39:51.125 --> 01:39:53.166
Napoleon's letters to his brother.

01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:54.875
Darwin's diaries.

01:39:54.958 --> 01:39:57.583
The first copy
of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.

01:39:58.333 --> 01:40:00.916
Chile's Declaration of Independence.

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:06.750
And several other gems that
we will auction for millions of pounds.

01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:11.250
[items clattering]

01:40:31.541 --> 01:40:33.666
[Margaret] This is
what the count achieved.

01:40:34.541 --> 01:40:41.500
Beyond the killing, his life's work
was to turn us into heroes of greed.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.875
[women's choir singing "Sanctus"]

01:40:50.666 --> 01:40:55.250
ARK

01:40:55.333 --> 01:41:01.333
[choir continues singing melancholy tune
in Latin]

01:41:15.583 --> 01:41:17.625
[motor approaching]

01:41:45.375 --> 01:41:47.375
[choral music rising]

01:42:18.625 --> 01:42:20.458
[choral music fades]

01:42:20.541 --> 01:42:25.166
[Margaret] It's well-known that vampires'
hearts are the most delicious by far.

01:42:25.666 --> 01:42:30.333
They are also the most efficient
for renewing our bodies.

01:42:32.666 --> 01:42:37.500
It's hard to explain, but every fiber
of heart that descends through our chests

01:42:37.583 --> 01:42:39.208
makes us younger.

01:42:39.708 --> 01:42:42.791
[choral music continues]

01:42:55.708 --> 01:42:57.250
[children shouting happily]

01:42:57.333 --> 01:43:01.083
[Margaret] My son preferred to remain
in this country of rubble.

01:43:01.166 --> 01:43:03.416
-I didn't have much choice.
-[school bell rings]

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.166
[Margaret] Children today
do as they please.

01:43:06.666 --> 01:43:09.750
He says that
the most dangerous leftists of all

01:43:09.833 --> 01:43:11.250
are right here.

01:43:11.333 --> 01:43:12.750
We shall see.

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.208
Perhaps I shall find it interesting,

01:43:16.291 --> 01:43:19.708
being rich in a country of the poor.

01:43:23.166 --> 01:43:26.416
If you want anything said, ask a man.

01:43:26.916 --> 01:43:30.750
If you want anything done, ask a woman.

01:43:32.458 --> 01:43:34.250
[choral music ends]

01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:38.583
THE END

01:43:38.666 --> 01:43:41.666
[mysterious chimes playing]

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:42.791
[upbeat march music playing]

01:46:19.833 --> 01:46:21.333
[upbeat march music ends]

01:46:21.416 --> 01:46:26.125
["Radetzky March"
by Johann Strauss playing]

01:48:53.625 --> 01:48:56.958
["Radetzky March"
by Johann Strauss continues]

01:50:30.416 --> 01:50:31.708
[music ends]
