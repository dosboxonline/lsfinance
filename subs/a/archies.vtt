00:41.250 --> 00:44.083
Tucked away behind the clouds
in the hills of North India

00:44.166 --> 00:46.416
is our little town, Riverdale.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.583
Our small town was built in 1914
by Sir John Riverdale.

00:49.666 --> 00:52.416
Did you know Sir Riverdale was
a British officer

00:52.500 --> 00:54.708
who was first posted to Bombay?

00:54.791 --> 00:57.041
Not sure if he could hold onto his job,

00:57.125 --> 00:59.541
but he definitely couldn't hold onto
his heart.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.250
He fell in love with the sunshine,
the Arabian Sea,

01:02.333 --> 01:04.083
the mogras, the pedas,

01:04.166 --> 01:07.291
and a beautiful local girl named Sitara.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.166
A wedding and four children later,

01:10.250 --> 01:14.125
one day, Sir John set out on a hunt
with his friend, the Prince of Sarna.

01:17.875 --> 01:20.166
Yet again,
he couldn't hold onto his heart.

01:20.250 --> 01:23.458
He fell in love with the blue skies
and the mountains.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.416
Sir John and his wife, Sitara,
put all their savings together,

01:27.500 --> 01:31.833
and leased this land from the
prince's father, the Maharaja of Sarna.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.625
They made a new town for people

01:35.708 --> 01:37.375
who were like Sir Riverdale's family,

01:37.458 --> 01:40.291
half British and half Indian.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.500
The Anglo-Indian community.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.583
Then India got its independence.

01:45.666 --> 01:47.666
The British headed home
while the Anglo-Indians

01:47.750 --> 01:50.500
wondered if they should stay back or…

01:50.583 --> 01:52.083
Many left for England,

01:52.166 --> 01:55.208
and the ones who loved their
country stayed back.

01:55.291 --> 01:58.916
Riverdale became home,
and the heart of this town was Green Park.

01:59.791 --> 02:02.833
Every citizen in Riverdale
has once planted a tree here.

02:02.916 --> 02:07.125
In other words, this is where the
community literally planted their roots.

02:15.833 --> 02:17.541
How beautiful is this!

02:17.625 --> 02:19.500
-This is Green Park.
-Yes, very nice.

02:19.583 --> 02:22.458
This is not just the heart,
but the history of Riverdale.

02:22.541 --> 02:24.833
We have a tradition here
known as "planting day".

02:25.458 --> 02:26.958
When kids turn five,

02:27.041 --> 02:29.833
their parents bring them here
to plant a tree.

02:29.916 --> 02:31.166
The trees have their names.

02:31.250 --> 02:32.083
Mine is over there.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.041
How special!

02:34.500 --> 02:36.958
I wish there was a park like this
in every town.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.958
Some things are worth fighting for.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.791
-Is that so?
-Yes!

02:40.875 --> 02:42.083
Are any of you musicians?

02:42.166 --> 02:43.291
I learned the sitar.

02:43.375 --> 02:44.833
Nice. Let me show you something.

02:44.916 --> 02:47.125
This beautiful pergola was a bandstand.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.083
Music played there and people danced here.

02:50.750 --> 02:54.125
This tradition started in 1914,
and in 1964, it's still alive.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.791
Can you guess who performed here last?

02:57.875 --> 02:59.625
-Elvis Presley?
-No!

03:00.125 --> 03:01.250
-Mohammed Rafi?
-No.

03:01.333 --> 03:02.166
Go on, tell us!

03:02.916 --> 03:03.791
The Archies.

03:03.875 --> 03:04.958
Who are The Archies?

03:05.041 --> 03:06.041
No idea.

03:06.125 --> 03:08.250
I've never heard of The Archies.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.791
Five years ago had you heard
of the Beatles?

03:10.875 --> 03:12.083
No, right?

03:12.166 --> 03:14.875
Mark my words.
The Archies are going to change the world.

03:14.958 --> 03:16.791
Then you can all proudly say,

03:16.875 --> 03:18.416
you met the lead singer. Me!

03:18.500 --> 03:19.416
Is he the singer?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.750
-You are a singer?
-Yes, I am.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.416
This special tour was designed
for you by Fred Andrews

03:24.500 --> 03:26.208
-of Andrews Tours and Travels.
-Thank you.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.083
Please enjoy Green Park.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.000
Thank you.

03:39.291 --> 03:40.750
Stop it, Betty!

03:43.958 --> 03:45.791
And tell that jukebox to stop.

03:45.875 --> 03:47.375
No! I love it.

03:51.291 --> 03:54.041
This is my story, listen up

03:56.500 --> 03:59.541
In my words, listen up

04:01.916 --> 04:05.416
The humming you hear

04:07.708 --> 04:10.291
Is the tune of the youth, listen up

04:13.083 --> 04:15.833
This is my story, listen up

04:18.291 --> 04:21.583
You can't ignore me, listen up

04:23.916 --> 04:26.916
All my impossible dreams

04:29.500 --> 04:32.166
Are right before me, you know

04:34.333 --> 04:39.458
In ever-changing waves

04:40.041 --> 04:43.333
This life flows, listen up…

04:47.625 --> 04:49.791
Aw, they're all here to welcome us.

04:49.875 --> 04:53.291
Of course!
You have to sing for your supper.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.666
-Smithers!
-Miss Lodge.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.333
Are we all set for the party?

04:57.416 --> 04:59.458
-Absolutely!
-Thank you.

04:59.541 --> 05:04.041
We can have anything we want

05:04.125 --> 05:07.625
We can pluck the stars, if we want

05:07.708 --> 05:14.583
We can grow flowers from rocks, if we want

05:21.000 --> 05:23.458
Aha!

05:28.875 --> 05:30.333
Listen up!

05:31.500 --> 05:32.333
Listen up!

05:36.416 --> 05:39.750
I feel like a new guy, my love

05:42.041 --> 05:44.791
Sunny swingin' blue skies above

05:47.583 --> 05:50.791
This is my story, you know

05:52.875 --> 05:56.083
Hear my story, listen up

05:58.458 --> 06:01.458
Why does life feel to us

06:03.875 --> 06:06.458
As beautiful as it does?
Listen up!

06:09.375 --> 06:12.791
Why is finding happiness

06:14.750 --> 06:17.958
So easy for us?
Listen up!

06:19.916 --> 06:24.333
In ever-changing waves

06:25.250 --> 06:28.833
This life flows, listen up

06:30.833 --> 06:35.541
It keeps telling us

06:36.250 --> 06:39.041
To feel the rhythm, listen up

06:39.125 --> 06:40.625
-Thank you.
-See you.

06:41.458 --> 06:42.666
Listen up!

06:44.375 --> 06:46.208
You say I'm young

06:46.291 --> 06:49.500
And I've got nowhere to be

06:49.583 --> 06:53.625
I say there's so much I can do

06:54.916 --> 06:57.291
Tradin' my shoes in

06:57.375 --> 07:00.250
For wheels under my feet

07:00.333 --> 07:05.541
I'm rockin' and rollin' past you

07:05.625 --> 07:06.625
Listen up!

07:08.791 --> 07:09.875
Listen up!

07:11.375 --> 07:12.250
Listen up!

07:17.875 --> 07:20.250
You returned at the right time, Mr. Lodge.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.625
Riverdale needs you.

07:23.583 --> 07:26.291
And the Council has accepted
your proposal.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.833
-I told you it would work.
-That you did!

07:28.916 --> 07:32.750
They have no objection to the plaza
coming up in the square.

07:32.833 --> 07:33.750
Excellent.

07:34.375 --> 07:37.208
Mr. Lodge,
these shops are private properties.

07:37.875 --> 07:41.125
But if the owners are ready to sell,
then it's fine.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.625
Everything has a price, Dawson.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.750
Let's get to the point.

07:46.250 --> 07:49.208
Have you moved on what we discussed?

07:49.291 --> 07:51.750
Will the Council give us permission
to build a hotel or not?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.458
Why wouldn't they? Of course they will.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.458
Only the location needs approval.

07:57.666 --> 07:58.875
I think…

08:00.666 --> 08:03.291
it would be best here.

08:04.416 --> 08:05.708
Well done, old chap!

08:05.791 --> 08:07.333
Not a bad idea.

08:07.416 --> 08:08.875
Mr. Dawson,

08:11.291 --> 08:13.291
you don't want to come to a new place

08:13.375 --> 08:16.458
and land up on the outskirts, now do you?

08:17.541 --> 08:19.583
You want to be where the life is.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.625
The food, the shops.

08:27.291 --> 08:28.833
Wouldn't this be better?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.625
But that's Green Park.

08:33.708 --> 08:36.625
That's your spot! Right in the heart…

08:36.708 --> 08:39.916
The hotel shouldn't be far
from the city center, Hiram.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.250
My best business ideas
come from my American.

08:47.208 --> 08:50.375
If we go for Green Park,
we'll cause a controversy.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.625
So it's needless to say, Dawson,

08:52.708 --> 08:55.000
my name can't be mentioned anywhere.

08:55.083 --> 08:57.583
Once the Council permissions go through,

08:57.666 --> 09:00.166
get tenders from a few companies.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.083
But naturally, you will select…

09:04.041 --> 09:05.125
Lodge Industries?

09:05.791 --> 09:07.166
Good man!

09:09.583 --> 09:12.166
We'll need five votes
to get the permission.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.708
But I will try my best, Mr. Lodge.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.666
-Try?
-Yes.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.750
Trying won't get you anywhere, Dawson.

09:18.833 --> 09:20.500
Now go get the votes.

09:24.208 --> 09:27.875
If I was the District Corporator,
I'd do it easily.

09:30.750 --> 09:34.208
So, what's stopping you
from standing for elections?

09:36.083 --> 09:38.583
Elections take a lot of money.

09:38.666 --> 09:40.875
You do understand, Mr. Lodge?

09:42.875 --> 09:44.541
Well done, Dawson!

09:47.958 --> 09:49.291
I'm impressed.

09:50.208 --> 09:52.458
Now help me help you.

09:52.541 --> 09:54.875
I want a hotel in Green Park.

09:56.833 --> 09:59.083
But first a plaza in the town square.

10:11.625 --> 10:12.875
Mango milkshake.

10:12.958 --> 10:15.166
Who's the best doggie in the world?

10:15.750 --> 10:16.666
Hamburger.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.958
Hot Dog, do you find Moosey handsome?

10:19.583 --> 10:20.625
Hotdog can't talk.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.208
Is that so, Hotdog?

10:25.291 --> 10:28.083
Put that burger down, Jones!

10:28.958 --> 10:30.750
Cut it from my tips, Pops.

10:30.833 --> 10:33.875
Your tab exceeds your tips.
There's nothing to cut.

10:33.958 --> 10:36.333
It's okay. I don't mind sharing.

10:37.833 --> 10:39.500
You should mind, Ethel.

10:39.583 --> 10:43.250
His only love is food.
He's oblivious to your feelings.

10:45.041 --> 10:46.583
What is "oblivious"?

10:48.083 --> 10:50.250
You don't know what "oblivious"
means, Moose?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.875
You've lived about 25 percent
of your life already,

10:55.958 --> 10:57.625
but what have you learned?

10:59.791 --> 11:00.625
Nothing!

11:03.208 --> 11:04.166
Moose!

11:19.000 --> 11:20.416
Aunty Hermione!

11:20.500 --> 11:21.791
Look who's here.

11:21.875 --> 11:24.583
Betty! Baby, how lovely to see you.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.458
-These are for you.
-Aw.

11:27.541 --> 11:29.875
-Put these in my bedroom, please.
-Sure.

11:29.958 --> 11:31.750
You all set for the party tonight?

11:32.333 --> 11:34.791
Still haven't worked out
your evening wear?

11:42.208 --> 11:43.625
"Darlings."

11:45.375 --> 11:48.833
I can't believe you could stick
eyelashes on. This is so mod.

11:48.916 --> 11:52.250
You keep it. I'll tell Dad to buy me more.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.458
No, two presents are enough!

11:55.958 --> 11:58.625
What happened to
"What's mine is yours", Betts?

11:59.458 --> 12:01.958
We still share everything, I hope?

12:02.041 --> 12:03.291
For always and ever.

12:04.791 --> 12:06.958
Okay. Now tell me.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.916
This one? Or this one?

12:12.416 --> 12:14.791
That's really cute,
and that's really short!

12:14.875 --> 12:17.083
It's called a mini.
It's all the rage in London.

12:17.166 --> 12:20.125
Don't forget you're not in London,
you're in Riverdale.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.833
And Riverdale should not forget

12:22.916 --> 12:24.333
that Veronica is back!

12:25.125 --> 12:26.625
I've missed you.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.375
So, tell me, how's Archie?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.625
Since I left…

12:32.833 --> 12:33.875
has he seen anyone else?

12:34.625 --> 12:36.625
He's dated everyone, but no one.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.583
I thought you didn't care.

12:40.125 --> 12:43.166
I don't. I just want to know the latest.

12:43.250 --> 12:46.750
The latest is that we all have
part-time jobs now.

12:47.541 --> 12:49.375
Jobs? Why?

12:50.000 --> 12:50.958
You're so cute.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.000
But I'm not in the mood for cute.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.416
-Look into the lens.
-Looking.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.250
-Hurry up, Doiley.
-Okay!

13:02.250 --> 13:03.250
Got it.

13:05.958 --> 13:07.083
Look at all this stuff!

13:07.791 --> 13:09.416
Ronnie throws the best parties.

13:10.125 --> 13:13.708
You know, Dad asked if there'd be
any adults at the party.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.541
I went "Dad, please. We're 17 now!"

13:16.625 --> 13:19.000
My Mom is the same. "Say no to booze!"

13:19.083 --> 13:20.583
Tell Aunty Jeannie,

13:20.666 --> 13:23.083
if you're already talking to a bottle,
it's too late!

13:24.166 --> 13:26.208
-So funny.
-Thank you, Dilly.

13:26.291 --> 13:30.041
Reggie doesn't crack jokes for free.
Go, get me a raspberry soda.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.625
-Okay. Do you want anything?
-No.

13:34.708 --> 13:36.958
Stop treating Dilly like your Man Friday.

13:37.791 --> 13:39.333
-I'm talking to you.
-Va!

13:40.416 --> 13:41.541
Look who's back.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.083
Welcome back, Veronica.

13:43.166 --> 13:44.291
Hi, Ronnie.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.375
You mean Va Va Voom?

13:51.208 --> 13:53.041
-Hi!
-Oh, hello.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.916
-Hello, Moosey.
-Hi, Ronnie!

13:57.000 --> 13:58.708
Hello, Sughead.

13:59.291 --> 14:00.166
My name is "Jughead".

14:00.958 --> 14:02.916
What's the "S" for?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.666
-Sandwich.
-Why?

14:06.666 --> 14:07.708
Where are we going?

14:07.791 --> 14:09.916
He's still scared of you.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.041
Hello.

14:11.875 --> 14:13.083
Hello!

14:13.166 --> 14:14.916
When did you get so handsome?

14:15.750 --> 14:16.666
Thank you.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.583
-You look good too, Arch.
-Thank you.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.791
I have something for you.

14:28.916 --> 14:30.500
Ronnie, what!

14:32.541 --> 14:33.875
Fresh off the press!

14:34.750 --> 14:36.083
Happy birthday to me!

14:36.666 --> 14:37.958
You know how to dance?

14:39.541 --> 14:40.958
I learned after you left.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.916
And I, before you left.

14:46.083 --> 14:47.833
Uno, dos

14:47.916 --> 14:49.666
One, two, tres, quatro

14:52.541 --> 14:54.000
Hey, wooly bully!

14:55.000 --> 14:56.250
Watch it, watch it

14:58.958 --> 15:00.625
Hey, y'all, hey, y'all

15:01.750 --> 15:02.708
Watch it!

15:03.958 --> 15:05.208
Now he'll get ya

15:11.750 --> 15:13.208
Matty told Hatty

15:14.500 --> 15:16.291
About a thing she saw

15:18.083 --> 15:19.666
Had two big horns

15:21.291 --> 15:23.083
And a wooly jaw

15:23.166 --> 15:26.333
Wooly bully

15:26.416 --> 15:27.333
Wooly bully

15:29.916 --> 15:30.916
Wooly bully

15:31.708 --> 15:35.000
Wooly bully, wooly bully

15:37.375 --> 15:38.916
Hatty told Matty

15:40.083 --> 15:41.791
"Let's don't take no chance

15:43.958 --> 15:45.791
"Let's not be L-seven

15:46.958 --> 15:48.625
"Come and learn to dance"

15:48.708 --> 15:50.583
Wooly bully

15:52.125 --> 15:53.583
Wooly bully

15:55.416 --> 16:00.208
Wooly bully, wooly bully, wooly bully

16:00.291 --> 16:01.625
Watch it!

16:27.833 --> 16:29.666
Matty told Hatty

16:31.000 --> 16:33.125
"That's the thing to do

16:34.750 --> 16:36.833
"Get you someone really

16:37.916 --> 16:39.958
"To pull the wool with you."

16:40.041 --> 16:42.875
Wooly bully

16:42.958 --> 16:44.333
Wooly bully

16:46.416 --> 16:51.208
Wooly bully, wooly bully, wooly bully

16:53.208 --> 16:54.500
Watch it! Watch it!

16:55.291 --> 16:56.958
Here he comes…

16:57.041 --> 16:58.458
-Good night! See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

16:58.541 --> 16:59.666
Ride safe, please.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.416
Yes, aunty Betty.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.333
Listen, you guys. Go ahead.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.125
Why? What is it?

17:07.208 --> 17:09.500
I forgot my record. You guys carry on.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.541
-We can wait.
-No, I'll walk.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.125
Bye.

17:13.208 --> 17:14.083
Okay.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.333
You forgot your record.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.125
What an old trick!

17:33.750 --> 17:35.208
The gift is dynamite!

17:36.083 --> 17:37.916
What can I give you in return?

17:39.416 --> 17:42.375
-Dinner? The CC.
-CC?

17:43.583 --> 17:45.375
Okay, let me go sell my guitar.

17:45.458 --> 17:48.125
If it's a problem, Reggie can take me.

17:48.208 --> 17:51.958
He sold his guitar before I left.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.875
Don't worry. Daddy is a member.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
No, I'll pay.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.333
Andrews!

18:00.416 --> 18:02.166
Forgot the way home?

18:02.250 --> 18:03.375
No, sir.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.791
Then remove yourself
from my property this instant.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.541
Daddy, stop being mean
to Archie all the time.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.250
Everyone's entitled to a hobby.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.541
Now! Andrews.

18:16.291 --> 18:17.875
On second thoughts,

18:17.958 --> 18:19.208
let your Dad pay the bill.

18:22.916 --> 18:23.750
Good night.

18:44.958 --> 18:50.625
End of June
All the days blow past the moon

18:50.708 --> 18:56.416
You can mark 'em with a notch
In the trees

19:00.250 --> 19:05.875
It's a cliché. But I'll tell you anyway

19:05.958 --> 19:12.083
I'm just hoping that you'll say
That you love me

19:22.916 --> 19:26.083
"Riverdale Town Council
Greenlights Redevelopment."

19:26.708 --> 19:28.333
Take it easy, Fred!

19:28.416 --> 19:30.666
It's probably why that bugger Lodge
came back.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.416
Must be wanting to build plazas
everywhere.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.541
So, good. We need more things.

19:35.625 --> 19:39.250
We need air to breathe,
food to eat and someone to love.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.958
We don't need "things".

19:41.041 --> 19:43.375
Or how'd Riverdale be any different
from any other town?

19:43.458 --> 19:46.000
"Hoga," Fred. The word is "hoga."

19:46.083 --> 19:48.208
Trying to teach your father
how to suck eggs, huh?

19:48.291 --> 19:49.208
Yes, I am.

19:49.291 --> 19:50.541
-Archie!
-Yeah?

19:51.625 --> 19:53.833
-What is this?
-Mom, why are you going through my stuff?

19:53.916 --> 19:56.625
Because I gave birth to you,
and you're still wet behind the ears.

19:57.125 --> 19:59.458
You applied to a college in England?

20:00.291 --> 20:02.833
Uncle Ben said if I want to live there,

20:02.916 --> 20:05.375
it's better if I studied there as well.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.541
You spoke to my brother first?

20:12.375 --> 20:14.375
You really want to leave Riverdale?

20:14.458 --> 20:16.416
I mean London is the world's
coolest city, Dad.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
Really?

20:17.583 --> 20:20.083
Yes! And I'm lucky I can go there easily,

20:20.166 --> 20:21.833
because grandpa was British.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.500
What will I do living here?

20:23.583 --> 20:26.041
Either work in your travel agency,
or in the railways.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.916
Imagine if Cliff Richard
had not left Lucknow.

20:29.625 --> 20:32.666
Trust me, parents.
Everything is possible there.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.375
I can make music that'll reach people.
Music that will really…

20:35.458 --> 20:38.916
To make art you have to go in,
my son, not out.

20:43.791 --> 20:45.833
"We know what we are,

20:47.083 --> 20:50.083
but know not what we may be."

20:51.000 --> 20:52.958
William Shakespeare said that.

20:54.916 --> 20:58.416
Nothing changes if nothing changes.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.875
Dilly, I don't like riddles.

21:01.958 --> 21:03.666
-It's not a riddle, it's a quote.
-Quote?

21:03.750 --> 21:05.750
But if you change the way
you look at life,

21:05.833 --> 21:08.958
the life you look at will change!

21:11.166 --> 21:13.166
Wonderful! Too good!

21:13.250 --> 21:14.416
Thank you.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.500
What Mr. Weatherbee is saying is that
change is inevitable.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.166
Excuse me, Miss Grundy.

21:24.791 --> 21:25.708
Yes, Mantle.

21:26.750 --> 21:29.375
If change is inevitable,

21:29.458 --> 21:31.875
then how come I didn't get mine back
from Jughead yesterday?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.500
Because I ate it!

21:34.583 --> 21:35.833
Jughead for Principal!

21:35.916 --> 21:36.875
Very clever!

21:39.041 --> 21:42.458
Okay! You kids have a bright future ahead.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.291
-Juggy, do you know about "UGAJ"?
-What's that?

21:47.375 --> 21:50.625
It's a group in school:
"United Girls Against Jughead."

21:51.416 --> 21:52.541
What did I do?

21:52.625 --> 21:53.791
I didn't join.

21:54.666 --> 21:56.666
-Please join.
-Ha-ha, very funny.

21:57.333 --> 21:58.791
How can they build a hotel here?

21:58.875 --> 22:00.875
Green Park will be gone?

22:04.458 --> 22:05.500
Thank you.

22:08.541 --> 22:10.375
Not the time to get emotional.

22:11.708 --> 22:12.958
I need you both.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.375
Tell me.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.166
You'll be on my side?

22:21.250 --> 22:25.166
If you run in the Corporator elections,
of course, you'll have our vote.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.208
Give!

22:29.166 --> 22:30.541
When I win,

22:30.625 --> 22:32.416
I'll make you Council Head,

22:33.708 --> 22:37.166
and you Council Secretary. I promise.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.208
And Gomes? He's your secretary now.

22:42.875 --> 22:44.125
True fact.

22:45.875 --> 22:47.875
But he has shown loyalty
only to Riverdale.

22:47.958 --> 22:50.875
He'll go straight and knock on
the Gazette's door.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.958
Knock-knock.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.791
Who's there?

22:56.875 --> 22:58.791
-Who!
-Who, who?

23:05.250 --> 23:09.041
What future will you have,
cracking stupid jokes, Reginald Mantle?

23:09.125 --> 23:11.750
Making people laugh is an art, Dad.

23:11.833 --> 23:13.708
I think there's a real profession
in comedy.

23:13.791 --> 23:18.333
A profession is a doctor, a lawyer,
an engineer, a journalist!

23:19.375 --> 23:24.708
Your grandfather didn't leave us
this newspaper to print a jokes column.

23:26.125 --> 23:28.750
When the British were ruling India,

23:29.500 --> 23:32.791
all the newspapers could only carry
their propaganda.

23:33.458 --> 23:36.166
No criticism was allowed.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.875
Despite that,

23:39.583 --> 23:43.041
your grandfather printed messages
for the freedom movement. In here.

23:43.833 --> 23:45.125
Did you know that?

23:46.041 --> 23:49.083
What he did then, we must do today.

23:49.958 --> 23:52.083
We have a social responsibility.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.041
Isn't that something I've taught you?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.708
So stop your clowning.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.666
And if you want to write,
write something meaningful.

24:02.958 --> 24:03.916
You can go.

24:10.875 --> 24:15.541
And as Giraffe gazed at the stars,
she said: "Drift me down into slumber.

24:16.375 --> 24:19.583
For when I'm the tallest,
I'm hoping to forget them.

24:20.291 --> 24:22.625
No matter how small-ish!"

24:23.916 --> 24:25.333
-Once more!
-Again.

24:25.416 --> 24:26.291
Again?

24:26.375 --> 24:27.791
-Yes, again.
-Once more, Uncle Hal.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.583
-Bye!
-Bye!

24:29.666 --> 24:30.750
-Let's go.
-Bye!

24:30.833 --> 24:31.666
Bye!

24:34.208 --> 24:35.208
Hal.

24:35.791 --> 24:38.083
Johnny, you're right on time!

24:39.041 --> 24:41.208
-Tea?
-No, thanks.

24:41.291 --> 24:45.083
I came to pick up Marge.
So I thought I'd have a word.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.166
All okay?

24:47.250 --> 24:50.166
I… I had an offer for this shop.

24:52.125 --> 24:53.708
It's a very good one, actually.

24:54.291 --> 24:55.750
I thought you're my best tenant,

24:55.833 --> 25:00.208
so I should ask you,
if you could match it or not.

25:01.750 --> 25:02.708
What's the offer?

25:05.416 --> 25:06.416
Double.

25:11.416 --> 25:14.333
Double? How can I manage that, Johnny?
I sell books.

25:19.250 --> 25:22.208
All right. Let me talk to Alice.

25:22.791 --> 25:24.083
I'll ring you.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.458
What are we going to do, Dad?

25:39.458 --> 25:41.625
"You cannot swim for new horizons

25:41.708 --> 25:46.625
until you have the courage
to lose sight of the shore."

25:47.875 --> 25:49.458
William Faulkner.

25:49.541 --> 25:50.458
Dad.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.250
Don't worry, Betts. We'll find a solution.

25:55.708 --> 25:57.166
But you tell me first,

25:58.666 --> 26:00.500
whose birthday is it in eight hours?

26:01.333 --> 26:02.833
What are you kids planning?

26:04.041 --> 26:06.916
Nothing. They forgot.

26:07.583 --> 26:08.416
I remembered.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.625
Yes, Ben, but I need a ballpark figure.

26:18.666 --> 26:20.583
How much is the yearly fee and housing?

26:20.666 --> 26:21.625
How do I look?

26:21.708 --> 26:23.541
Just like you did an hour ago.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.125
Don't be grumpy, Mary.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.083
I'm trying to think
how to fund your education.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.875
Uncle Ben said he'll take care of it.

26:29.666 --> 26:32.375
Your education is my problem.
I will take care of it.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.791
I don't want to be a problem.

26:34.875 --> 26:36.333
Too late for that.

26:38.291 --> 26:39.125
Bye.

26:41.708 --> 26:44.125
I just got back and you're off to London.

26:44.208 --> 26:46.291
Let's see. I've only just applied.

26:46.375 --> 26:47.875
You'll get in.

26:47.958 --> 26:49.958
I'm sorry, but you have to
wear shoes to enter.

26:50.041 --> 26:53.083
Shoes are the shackles
of our civilization, sir.

26:53.166 --> 26:57.458
And this is the protocol of our CC.
Only brogues or loafers.

26:57.541 --> 26:58.833
But I am a loafer.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.125
May I use your phone, please?

27:09.250 --> 27:12.583
Hello. Hi, Katy. Can I speak to Daddy?

27:12.666 --> 27:14.625
-Who's Katy?
-My father's P.A.

27:15.708 --> 27:18.791
You have to go through a P.A.
to talk to your Dad?

27:19.625 --> 27:20.875
He's a busy man.

27:22.166 --> 27:24.333
Hello. Hi, Daddy.

27:24.416 --> 27:27.083
Can you speak to this chappy at the CC?

27:27.166 --> 27:28.791
He's not letting Archie in.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.375
Mr. Lodge for you.

27:34.333 --> 27:35.541
Please follow me.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.833
Betty, get the door.

27:50.333 --> 27:51.166
Hotdog?

27:51.250 --> 27:52.791
Surprise!

27:52.875 --> 27:55.666
-Surprise!
-The party's here!

27:55.750 --> 27:57.125
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

27:58.791 --> 28:00.291
-Happy birthday, Betts.
-Thank you.

28:00.375 --> 28:01.583
-This is Rita.
-Hi, Rita.

28:01.666 --> 28:03.083
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

28:03.166 --> 28:04.208
Thank you.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.833
Where are Ronnie and Arch?

28:10.208 --> 28:12.333
Alice, come. Midge has got a cake.

28:12.416 --> 28:14.625
I'll have the trout with
the glazed potatoes.

28:14.708 --> 28:15.750
Very good, ma'am.

28:15.833 --> 28:16.791
And for you, sir?

28:16.875 --> 28:19.416
Does this lamb cure asthma?

28:19.500 --> 28:21.166
I don't think so, sir.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.083
Why does it cost so much?

28:25.375 --> 28:26.500
Sorry.

28:27.125 --> 28:30.041
-Just get him the lamb. Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

28:32.208 --> 28:35.500
So, Archiekins? What you been up to?

28:35.583 --> 28:37.291
Where do I start?

28:37.375 --> 28:40.541
Two years ago. When our story stopped.

28:40.625 --> 28:42.375
I missed you a lot.

28:42.458 --> 28:44.250
Details, Archiekins!

28:45.958 --> 28:49.208
When you were gone
Everything was the same

28:49.916 --> 28:52.750
Yet life seemed so empty

28:52.833 --> 28:56.625
I was happy where I was

28:56.708 --> 29:00.083
But I kept missing you

29:00.166 --> 29:03.083
Sometimes in a dream

29:03.166 --> 29:06.375
I would see you

29:06.916 --> 29:08.625
Dreams only show you

29:08.708 --> 29:10.083
The people who live

29:10.166 --> 29:13.708
Deep in your heart

29:13.791 --> 29:16.958
Don't you know that the flick in her eyes

29:17.041 --> 29:19.333
Is to trick every guy in the queue

29:20.333 --> 29:23.500
Don't you know that he's just a flirt

29:23.583 --> 29:26.833
With a smile like dessert made for you?

29:27.541 --> 29:30.791
How did the days go by without me?

29:30.875 --> 29:34.333
I counted the days that would pass me by

29:34.416 --> 29:37.625
That's how the days went by without you

29:37.708 --> 29:39.125
He's only playing

29:39.208 --> 29:43.833
She's only playing with you

29:44.625 --> 29:46.041
He's only playing

29:46.125 --> 29:51.166
She's only playing with you

29:54.958 --> 29:57.708
I was away for many a day

29:58.416 --> 30:01.541
But came right back to stay

30:01.625 --> 30:04.333
Now you are here and so am I

30:05.166 --> 30:08.625
Shall we sail on the wind and fly away?

30:08.708 --> 30:11.416
Don't you know that a touch on your arm

30:11.500 --> 30:14.583
Is just part of the charm that she'll use?

30:15.458 --> 30:18.041
Don't you know that right from the start

30:18.125 --> 30:22.166
It was all just a part of his ruse?

30:22.250 --> 30:25.666
With you by my side
What woes could I have?

30:25.750 --> 30:29.083
With you by my side, what could I lack?

30:29.166 --> 30:32.500
Is this why the spring is back?

30:32.583 --> 30:34.041
He's only playing

30:34.125 --> 30:36.166
She's only playing with you

30:36.250 --> 30:39.375
She's only playing with you

30:39.458 --> 30:40.916
He's only playing

30:41.000 --> 30:43.208
She's only playing with you

30:43.291 --> 30:46.166
He's only playing with you

30:46.250 --> 30:47.833
He's only playing

30:47.916 --> 30:52.291
She's only playing with you

30:59.416 --> 31:00.666
That was nice.

31:01.833 --> 31:03.083
I always have fun with you.

31:03.166 --> 31:05.791
Me too. I always have fun with me.

31:09.416 --> 31:11.333
So… what happens next?

31:11.958 --> 31:15.416
-Next?
-Yeah. You and me. Like old times.

31:16.583 --> 31:20.291
Or you and me like this? New times.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.625
"To my Elizabeth…"

31:31.708 --> 31:32.916
Mom!

31:42.708 --> 31:44.958
Do you know what time it is?

31:45.041 --> 31:48.125
-I'm hungry.
-Why? I heard you had dinner with Ronnie.

31:48.208 --> 31:51.333
You've been to CC?
Everything is this "wee-wee".

31:51.416 --> 31:52.958
I have to get up early.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.125
No, you don't. It's the weekend.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.958
It's Saturday tomorrow.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.375
Please.

32:05.166 --> 32:07.500
"Betty bought some butter,
but the butter was bitter…"

32:07.583 --> 32:08.458
Shut up!

32:10.625 --> 32:13.208
No one makes scrambled eggs like you.

32:13.291 --> 32:16.083
And no one can butter me up like you.

32:16.166 --> 32:17.416
Oh! Really?

32:19.500 --> 32:22.125
So? You're back with Ronnie?

32:22.833 --> 32:24.916
No. That's old times.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Take this to my room. I need to clean up.

32:32.416 --> 32:34.541
-Quietly.
-Sorry. Thank you.

32:48.375 --> 32:51.416
"Happy birthday, Betty.
Please return what you don't eat."

32:52.333 --> 32:53.791
That's from Jughead.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.583
I saved this for you.

33:01.125 --> 33:02.583
I'm so sorry, Betty.

33:02.666 --> 33:05.250
I forgot it was your birthday.
I have no excuse.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.041
-It's okay.
-No, it's not!

33:07.125 --> 33:09.500
Please get angry.
Throw that cake at my face.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.041
I'd rather you eat it.

33:11.833 --> 33:13.125
Me too.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.041
Okay, listen. Tomorrow evening.
Only you and me.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.958
In our favorite place. Green Park.

33:18.833 --> 33:19.708
For a date?

33:19.791 --> 33:22.625
Yes, you and me. Good times.

33:27.958 --> 33:29.500
It's so cute!

33:30.666 --> 33:32.041
For always and ever.

33:32.125 --> 33:34.083
Thank you. I love it.

33:35.625 --> 33:38.750
About last night, I'm sorry.

33:38.833 --> 33:40.500
You should be! You forgot me.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.750
-No! Don't say that.
-So what should I say?

33:43.833 --> 33:45.958
Just forgive me, please!

33:46.041 --> 33:47.333
Okay. Fine.

33:47.416 --> 33:51.208
She gave you this expensive necklace
because she forgot your birthday.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.750
Don't be mean. Ronnie isn't like that.

33:55.083 --> 33:56.083
And Archie?

33:56.666 --> 34:00.083
-He's taking me out.
-He takes every girl out, Betts.

34:01.375 --> 34:02.458
He'll change.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.125
Look.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.541
Archie and a dog's tail
will never straighten.

34:08.250 --> 34:09.708
What did Ronnie say?

34:11.125 --> 34:12.791
I haven't told her.

34:12.875 --> 34:15.458
Forget Archie for a minute.

34:15.541 --> 34:18.500
Just look at him! It's Shammi Kapoor!

34:19.750 --> 34:21.791
Pam ma'am, are you selling the shop?

34:22.541 --> 34:24.083
Over my dead body.

34:24.708 --> 34:28.291
You know there's a new salon
opening across the road?

34:28.375 --> 34:30.375
I know, I know!
Everyone is talking about it.

34:30.458 --> 34:34.208
My friend Asha told me
they've all kinds of fancy equipment.

34:34.750 --> 34:38.416
I don't need fancy equipment, darling.
I have Ethel.

34:42.583 --> 34:47.708
Pam's salon, Suzie's flower shop,
Hal's book shop.

34:48.958 --> 34:51.791
Send them the offers on behalf
of Lodge Industries.

34:52.583 --> 34:55.666
The plaza's construction
cannot be delayed.

34:56.750 --> 34:58.625
Got it, Gomes? Okay.

34:59.666 --> 35:01.041
Is that all for today?

35:01.125 --> 35:04.416
Yes, Mrs. Otter. That is all for the day.

35:06.958 --> 35:10.958
Next session we vote
on the location of the hotel.

35:17.125 --> 35:18.750
I had an idea.

35:20.500 --> 35:23.250
What if we build this grand hotel

35:24.750 --> 35:26.666
in the center of the town?

35:26.750 --> 35:28.375
-Center?
-Yes.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.541
You mean the square?

35:31.833 --> 35:33.583
No. I mean the park.

35:33.666 --> 35:36.083
-Green Park?
-Yes!

35:36.166 --> 35:38.041
Imagine, Mrs. Misquitta,

35:38.125 --> 35:42.208
how many tourists we'd attract.
How many new opportunities!

35:42.291 --> 35:43.791
-It could change everything.
-Yes!

35:43.875 --> 35:45.208
Over my dead body, Roger.

35:45.291 --> 35:47.416
Has that wig eaten your brain?

35:50.041 --> 35:53.375
That is our community park, Mr. Dawson.

35:55.375 --> 35:57.375
You've had a very bad idea.

36:02.083 --> 36:04.125
Okay. Enjoy the biscuits!

36:04.208 --> 36:05.708
Oh, I will.

36:10.750 --> 36:14.291
This is Mrs. Misquitta.
She's Mrs. Otter's sidekick.

36:15.666 --> 36:17.416
This is Mrs. Otter.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.208
She's a widow?

36:19.291 --> 36:22.541
Yes. She's the sole bread-earner
in her family.

36:23.750 --> 36:24.833
Doesn't her son work?

36:28.666 --> 36:30.166
How wonderful!

36:44.916 --> 36:47.375
Oh, my! Elizabeth Cooper.

36:48.416 --> 36:49.666
-That's Archie.
-I'll get it.

36:49.750 --> 36:53.416
Elizabeth, you know you share your name
with the Queen?

36:53.500 --> 36:54.458
Yes, Ma.

36:54.541 --> 36:58.083
So, your behavior should be like royalty.

36:58.166 --> 36:59.208
Yes, Ma.

36:59.958 --> 37:01.875
Listen to me now, Betty.

37:01.958 --> 37:04.416
That tingly feeling you get
when you like a boy?

37:05.375 --> 37:07.250
That is common sense leaving your body.

37:07.791 --> 37:09.791
Do not follow that feeling!

37:10.416 --> 37:12.541
No giggling! Elizabeth!

37:15.708 --> 37:18.208
Va Va Voom! Betts! Happy Birthday!

37:18.291 --> 37:19.625
Arch!

37:20.541 --> 37:22.333
-This is for me?
-No.

37:22.416 --> 37:23.916
Of course, it's for you, who else?

37:24.000 --> 37:25.750
But it must've been expensive, no?

37:25.833 --> 37:28.083
Yeah! I saved my pocket money.
Come, let's go!

37:28.875 --> 37:30.375
You look really nice, by the way.

37:47.125 --> 37:51.333
Mid-July, I wished upon a firefly

37:51.416 --> 37:55.500
I think my heart will burst
Through the seams

37:57.875 --> 38:01.750
My, oh, my! Now I'm rollin' with the guy

38:01.833 --> 38:06.875
I've been picturing all night in my dreams

38:06.958 --> 38:11.458
Oh! I've been picturing all night…

38:11.541 --> 38:15.500
…in my dreams

38:21.750 --> 38:23.541
I'll really miss this park.

38:24.541 --> 38:27.333
I'm sure you'll find another tree,
monkey boy.

38:27.416 --> 38:29.041
London must have parks too.

38:29.125 --> 38:31.791
But nothing like our Green Park.

38:32.750 --> 38:34.166
Our trees won't be there.

38:35.208 --> 38:36.875
And my Betty Cooper won't be there.

38:39.958 --> 38:40.875
What?

38:41.416 --> 38:43.750
Some moments are so special that

38:43.833 --> 38:46.041
you know when they're over
your heart will break.

38:48.625 --> 38:51.500
Hearts don't break, Betts.
They just fracture.

38:52.416 --> 38:53.833
Time heals everything.

38:54.583 --> 38:57.041
Bet you're thinking what
a great philosopher I am.

38:57.125 --> 38:59.291
I'm thinking what a great idiot you are.

39:01.750 --> 39:02.625
Where you going?

39:02.708 --> 39:04.375
Where do you think?

39:17.416 --> 39:19.125
I had the best birthday.

39:19.208 --> 39:21.416
You deserve it. You're the best girl.

39:41.666 --> 39:43.625
-Good night.
-Good night.

40:07.666 --> 40:09.125
You kissed Betty?

40:09.208 --> 40:10.166
Like kissed-kissed?

40:10.250 --> 40:11.791
-With tongue?
-Jughead.

40:11.875 --> 40:13.958
Yes, it was a French kiss.

40:15.750 --> 40:17.833
But you were with Ronnie the night before.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.583
-I thought you liked her.
-I do.

40:20.666 --> 40:22.916
Ronnie is amazing
but Betty is first-class too.

40:24.375 --> 40:27.166
And Cheryl, Deena, Angie, Monica.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.583
Forgotten them?

40:29.166 --> 40:30.625
You've kissed them all in French?

40:30.708 --> 40:33.000
What can I do if they like me?

40:34.708 --> 40:38.041
Arch! Betty and Ronnie are best friends.

40:38.125 --> 40:41.625
One day they'll talk,
then what'll become of you, Andrews?

40:43.041 --> 40:45.666
-You cannot two-time them.
-I'm not two-timing.

40:46.458 --> 40:48.000
I really love both of them.

40:52.416 --> 40:55.666
God! This is not gonna end well.

41:37.625 --> 41:41.541
He dates one. Then the other

41:41.625 --> 41:44.375
He spins many a yarn

41:45.250 --> 41:49.500
He cheats this one
Then the other

41:49.583 --> 41:53.125
Now we'll set him straight!

41:53.208 --> 41:56.416
He better watch his back all right

41:56.500 --> 42:01.208
We'll rejoice in taking revenge
For every betrayal

42:01.291 --> 42:04.750
He better watch his back all right

42:04.833 --> 42:08.208
'Cause he's got the bark
But we've got the bite

42:09.625 --> 42:11.208
Now he'll know his crimes

42:11.291 --> 42:13.166
Now he'll toe the line

42:13.250 --> 42:17.000
His flirting days are over

42:17.083 --> 42:20.666
He'll be walking the straight and narrow

42:21.541 --> 42:24.833
Now he'll keep his promises

42:24.916 --> 42:28.500
He better watch his back all right

42:28.583 --> 42:32.958
Come what may, we won't spare him

42:33.041 --> 42:36.791
He better watch his back all right

42:36.875 --> 42:40.708
'Cause he's got the bark
But we've got the bite

42:41.416 --> 42:44.416
He better watch his back all right

42:44.500 --> 42:48.666
We'll rejoice in taking revenge
For every betrayal

42:49.291 --> 42:52.583
He better watch his back all right

42:52.666 --> 42:56.291
'Cause he's got the bark
But we've got the bite

42:57.375 --> 42:58.833
He's got the bark

43:01.083 --> 43:02.666
But we've got the bite!

43:06.500 --> 43:07.875
Go, Ronnie! Go, Betty!

43:09.791 --> 43:12.208
Andrews! Just trust me.
Don't do this, please.

43:12.291 --> 43:15.166
If they find out,
they'll get together and murder you.

43:15.250 --> 43:17.708
-What do you want me to do?
-Just back off now!

43:18.666 --> 43:21.541
If you die, I'll be forced to make Moose
my best friend.

43:21.625 --> 43:23.625
Can't stop talking to them.
They're my friends.

43:23.708 --> 43:24.708
Then act like a friend.

43:26.666 --> 43:29.291
Focus on some other girl.
Someone with no complications.

43:29.375 --> 43:31.291
Forget about Betty and Ronnie.

43:32.750 --> 43:34.583
-Best.
-Best.

43:36.708 --> 43:38.041
Whoa, Cheryl!

43:40.750 --> 43:42.583
You were groovy, Cheryl.

43:42.666 --> 43:44.958
-What!
-Why waste time?

43:45.041 --> 43:46.583
Three cheers for Cheryl!

43:46.666 --> 43:48.208
Cherry Blossom!

43:49.125 --> 43:50.416
Cherry Blossom!

43:51.750 --> 43:53.708
Cherry Blossom!

43:53.791 --> 43:55.916
-What the hell!
-Cherry Blossom!

43:56.791 --> 43:58.250
Cherry Blossom!

43:59.125 --> 44:00.500
Cherry Blossom!

44:01.125 --> 44:03.916
-I warned you. A dog's tail!
-Cherry Blossom!

44:04.458 --> 44:05.583
Cherry Blossom!

44:07.083 --> 44:08.583
Cherry Blossom!

44:26.041 --> 44:27.125
Hi.

44:27.916 --> 44:29.458
You're Ethel, right?

44:30.958 --> 44:32.625
Want to come in and take a look?

44:33.500 --> 44:34.625
Come on.

44:36.958 --> 44:37.958
Oh, shoot!

44:39.166 --> 44:41.083
Welcome to Cuts and Curls!

44:42.916 --> 44:46.666
Everyone says you are Riverdale's
upcoming hairdresser.

44:46.750 --> 44:48.583
I've learnt from the best.

44:48.666 --> 44:49.791
How nice!

44:49.875 --> 44:52.750
Respecting your teachers is a good thing.

44:53.875 --> 44:55.083
Want a drink?

44:55.791 --> 44:57.041
No, thank you.

44:57.125 --> 44:59.541
So I'll come straight to the point.

45:00.208 --> 45:02.666
Would you like to work for me?

45:08.958 --> 45:11.458
-I'm already employed at Pam's salon--
-I know.

45:12.625 --> 45:15.583
And I also know your salary there.

45:15.666 --> 45:18.291
Work with me and I'll double it.

45:19.458 --> 45:22.333
You have the right to get ahead in life.

45:22.416 --> 45:24.958
The world is modernizing, Ethel.

45:25.041 --> 45:26.666
Don't get left behind.

45:32.916 --> 45:34.625
Guys! Is it just me?

45:34.708 --> 45:36.583
Or has Reggie been looking great?

45:41.833 --> 45:43.291
It's you.

45:43.375 --> 45:44.666
Hi.

45:46.125 --> 45:47.041
Hi.

45:56.583 --> 45:57.416
Reg.

45:58.833 --> 46:00.791
Who are you taking to the Founders' Ball?

46:02.041 --> 46:04.333
I promised Lynn that I'd take her.

46:04.958 --> 46:06.958
Promises are meant to be broken, Mantle.

46:12.125 --> 46:13.375
Poor Lynn.

46:15.875 --> 46:17.416
-She asked Reggie?
-Good.

46:17.500 --> 46:19.250
You focus on Cherry Blossom.

46:22.500 --> 46:23.750
I told you. Girls have powers.

46:23.833 --> 46:24.791
-She heard me.
-Shut up.

46:24.875 --> 46:25.708
Hi.

46:25.791 --> 46:28.208
Hello. I thought I'd find you here.

46:28.875 --> 46:30.041
What a memory!

46:30.666 --> 46:33.375
So, Saturday? Founders' Ball?

46:33.458 --> 46:35.500
Make new memories?

46:40.000 --> 46:41.208
You got it.

46:44.250 --> 46:46.291
She asked you out. Very good.

46:46.375 --> 46:47.958
Va Va Voom!

46:49.625 --> 46:50.625
Guys, just shut up!

46:52.000 --> 46:53.541
What's wrong with you, Archie Andrews?

46:53.625 --> 46:55.541
Nothing, Ethel Muggs. I'm single.

46:55.625 --> 46:57.416
No, you're just a philanderer!

46:58.500 --> 46:59.958
Who's "Phil Anderson"?

47:00.041 --> 47:04.333
-Good morning, students.
-Good morning, Teacher.

47:08.666 --> 47:11.208
Betty can't go alone. She needs a date.

47:11.291 --> 47:13.458
I'm going with my Mom.

47:13.541 --> 47:15.833
No. Aunty Jeannie will go with your Dad.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.916
-And you'll go with Betty.
-Don't bully him.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.583
I'm not bullying him.

47:20.083 --> 47:21.333
Dilly, am I bullying you?

47:22.875 --> 47:27.125
Wouldn't it be more fun going
with Betty, Reggie, and me?

47:27.958 --> 47:28.958
Reggie?

47:29.541 --> 47:30.833
Betty, I'd love to go with you.

47:31.750 --> 47:33.583
Good. All done!

47:36.833 --> 47:37.708
What's that?

47:37.791 --> 47:39.708
Inventing something new?

47:39.791 --> 47:43.750
It was invented years ago.
I'm trying to make one at home.

47:43.833 --> 47:45.916
What is it? A fridge?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.208
Ronnie, don't be ridiculous!

47:48.291 --> 47:50.166
When did you last enter a kitchen?

47:50.750 --> 47:52.500
That's a lovely picture of your grandma.

47:52.583 --> 47:54.583
What! That's Hedy Lamarr.

47:54.666 --> 47:56.416
She invented frequency hopping.

47:56.500 --> 47:59.041
The technology was used a lot
in World War II.

47:59.125 --> 48:01.875
Hedy Lamarr? Isn't she an actress?

48:01.958 --> 48:03.333
Why can't a person be both?

48:03.416 --> 48:04.708
You're so smart, Dilly.

48:04.791 --> 48:06.625
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

48:06.708 --> 48:08.000
Thank you!

48:11.250 --> 48:12.708
Here you are, Jughead.

48:13.625 --> 48:15.958
World's best biscuits, Uncle Benny.

48:16.041 --> 48:18.458
I'll make a box for you.
You've been my best client.

48:19.416 --> 48:20.958
"Been?" I still am.

48:21.041 --> 48:24.291
The City Council is not renewing
my licence.

48:25.291 --> 48:27.416
They have new plans for the park.

48:28.333 --> 48:31.291
-Who told you that?
-No one has said it straight.

48:32.041 --> 48:34.458
But I have ears and eyes.

48:35.500 --> 48:36.791
I can see.

48:42.083 --> 48:44.000
These guys were at Pop's café too.

48:46.250 --> 48:47.958
-The elevation over there…
-Yeah.

48:48.041 --> 48:48.875
Redevelopment?

48:49.416 --> 48:50.416
Green Park?

48:51.250 --> 48:54.333
Uncle Benny told me. The Town Council
isn't renewing his licence.

48:54.416 --> 48:56.500
Uncle Benny from the snack shop?

48:57.500 --> 48:58.541
He's your source?

48:59.708 --> 49:01.041
I saw it with my own eyes, Dad.

49:01.125 --> 49:03.166
Some city men were surveying the place.

49:03.250 --> 49:06.458
-There's definitely a plan.
-What are you talking about, Reg?

49:06.541 --> 49:09.458
Our community's roots are in Green Park.

49:10.041 --> 49:11.500
The Council will never allow it.

49:12.125 --> 49:13.583
They'll never pass it.

49:13.666 --> 49:16.625
Find facts, son. Not conspiracy theories.

49:17.750 --> 49:19.333
Yeah, you're right, Ricky.

49:19.416 --> 49:20.416
Play on, Dennis.

49:32.875 --> 49:35.458
Kevin never mentioned you.

49:36.041 --> 49:39.791
That is one of the things I respected
most about your husband, Mrs. Otter.

49:39.875 --> 49:41.166
He never name-dropped.

49:42.583 --> 49:45.250
He would personally make my drink
every evening

49:46.333 --> 49:49.833
and with that whisky,
we'd share the same cigarette.

49:50.625 --> 49:53.750
-It was our ritual.
-My Kevin didn't smoke.

49:55.958 --> 50:00.041
He knew how much you hated it,
and didn't want to bother you.

50:00.125 --> 50:02.833
Well, he did die of cancer and that…

50:02.916 --> 50:04.583
has been a bit of a bother.

50:05.500 --> 50:06.583
I know.

50:07.375 --> 50:09.791
And that is precisely
why I've called you here.

50:12.541 --> 50:15.791
Kevin was not just a bartender here,

50:17.416 --> 50:18.541
he was my friend.

50:18.625 --> 50:22.083
It is my responsibility to make sure that

50:22.833 --> 50:24.458
his son is well settled.

50:25.583 --> 50:27.666
My son!

50:29.083 --> 50:30.333
He's failed twice.

50:31.250 --> 50:33.291
That Laurie is a duffer.

50:33.375 --> 50:35.458
Don't worry about that, Mrs. Otter.

50:35.541 --> 50:37.458
Because I've heard the Town Council is

50:37.541 --> 50:41.833
considering giving approval for a hotel
to be built in Green Park.

50:41.916 --> 50:43.125
Can you believe that?

50:43.208 --> 50:45.916
-I'm not so sure--
-If that happens,

50:46.000 --> 50:48.083
I'm going to be investing in it.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.750
And maybe I could offer Laurie
a managerial position.

50:52.666 --> 50:54.583
He could work at the hotel.

50:54.666 --> 50:58.458
I mean if he has half of Kevin's looks,

50:58.541 --> 51:00.583
and a quarter of your charm,

51:01.208 --> 51:03.500
he would be perfect
in the service industry.

51:03.583 --> 51:06.166
The Council will vote after
the Founder's Ball.

51:06.250 --> 51:07.500
So fingers crossed.

51:07.583 --> 51:09.125
We must get a picture.

51:09.208 --> 51:11.875
Ronnie, I think we should
take a photo together.

51:11.958 --> 51:13.541
Absolutely not!

51:14.708 --> 51:15.583
Why?

51:15.666 --> 51:18.750
Then everyone will know
that I came with you.

51:18.833 --> 51:20.083
But you are coming with me!

51:20.166 --> 51:22.125
Yes, but there's no need for proof.

51:23.916 --> 51:24.958
Smile!

51:25.500 --> 51:28.500
Lonely July

51:30.083 --> 51:32.583
The skies are gray…

51:34.875 --> 51:37.000
Bobby is with someone else.

51:38.250 --> 51:39.291
Sorry.

51:43.958 --> 51:46.458
These are some days

51:46.541 --> 51:50.833
I could erase from my mind

51:53.208 --> 51:56.416
But then my life plays

51:56.500 --> 52:01.583
Funny games all the time…

52:02.333 --> 52:04.375
Can we stop inviting him?

52:08.000 --> 52:09.125
Come.

52:09.833 --> 52:13.625
Hey, guys! No one told me
it's a fancy-dress competition.

52:14.583 --> 52:16.916
The first prize goes to the chicken.

52:18.208 --> 52:19.750
Reggie!

52:19.833 --> 52:21.333
-Hey, pip-squeak! Move.
-Don't push.

52:21.416 --> 52:23.375
Hey, man. Anybody home?

52:23.458 --> 52:25.125
Easy. It was just a joke.

52:25.208 --> 52:28.333
Joke about Dilly and I'll pop your head
like a champagne bottle!

52:28.416 --> 52:30.875
Boys! The party hasn't even started

52:30.958 --> 52:33.250
and you little pissers are
at each other's throats.

52:33.333 --> 52:34.583
Off!

52:37.166 --> 52:40.333
Wear whatever you want to. Okay? Come on.

52:41.958 --> 52:43.083
Very nice.

52:43.750 --> 52:44.958
Should we dance?

52:47.416 --> 52:48.416
Not to this.

52:48.500 --> 52:49.750
Look into the camera.

53:00.541 --> 53:01.666
I'll just be back.

53:01.750 --> 53:02.916
What the hell?

53:03.750 --> 53:04.583
Hi!

53:05.916 --> 53:07.666
Wait! Betts!

53:07.750 --> 53:10.083
Why? Did Miss Blossom ditch you?

53:10.166 --> 53:12.000
This may be my last Founders' Ball.

53:12.083 --> 53:14.000
I want us all to enjoy it together.

53:14.541 --> 53:17.625
Last? Meaning? Aren't you
coming back from England?

53:21.291 --> 53:23.208
I've written a song for you.

53:24.500 --> 53:25.666
I'm going to play it tonight.

53:28.125 --> 53:29.916
I don't know what to say.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.125
Then don't say… just dance.

53:38.791 --> 53:42.416
If you're desperately chasing Betty,
why did you invite me?

53:43.125 --> 53:44.625
Actually, you invited me.

53:44.708 --> 53:45.958
How rude!

53:46.041 --> 53:49.166
And I'll have you know
I just wanted to make Daryl jealous.

53:49.250 --> 53:50.166
So…

53:50.958 --> 53:52.125
Daryl is a lucky guy.

53:52.958 --> 53:55.000
-Go find your friends.
-I will.

53:58.666 --> 53:59.541
Nice.

54:02.833 --> 54:03.875
Nice dress.

54:05.541 --> 54:07.666
Can't say the same for your drapery.

54:08.625 --> 54:10.541
Ronnie, can I talk to you?

54:10.625 --> 54:12.791
Why? Are cherries out of season?

54:13.750 --> 54:14.708
That's funny!

54:15.791 --> 54:18.583
But personally, I think every season
is Ronnie season.

54:19.958 --> 54:24.083
Flattery will get you nowhere.
But keep trying, because I like it.

54:24.833 --> 54:27.041
Okay. I've written a song for you.

54:28.625 --> 54:29.916
Now forgive me.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.583
Let's hear it first. See if it's any good.

54:34.375 --> 54:39.500
But then my life plays funny games

54:39.583 --> 54:42.208
All the time

54:43.291 --> 54:46.666
Lonely July

54:46.750 --> 54:48.750
-Michael, you're the best.
-Beautiful, Michael!

54:48.833 --> 54:49.833
You're amazing!

54:49.916 --> 54:52.000
Love you! And you!

54:52.083 --> 54:53.041
And me!

54:53.583 --> 54:55.208
The next number is…

54:55.291 --> 54:56.416
"Va Va Voom!"

54:56.500 --> 54:58.250
-I didn't write that.
-I know.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.583
Good evening, everyone.

55:02.666 --> 55:04.791
On a night dedicated to
Sir John Riverdale,

55:04.875 --> 55:06.750
I'm going to perform a song

55:06.833 --> 55:08.708
I wrote for a really special girl
in my life.

55:10.666 --> 55:14.333
So let's hear it for our Founders
and let's move it for The Archies!

55:20.291 --> 55:22.250
Can we clear the stage, please?

55:22.333 --> 55:23.708
On your mark, get set!

55:23.791 --> 55:25.416
One, two, three, go!

55:51.583 --> 55:52.750
Va Va Voom!

55:52.833 --> 55:54.208
Va Va Va Voom!

55:54.291 --> 55:57.291
When I see her my heart flies away

55:57.375 --> 55:59.083
Va Va Voom!

55:59.166 --> 56:00.041
Va Va Va Voom!

56:00.125 --> 56:03.291
Get what I'm trying to say?

56:03.375 --> 56:06.208
When my eyes fell on her lovely face

56:06.291 --> 56:09.375
No one in this world has her grace

56:09.458 --> 56:12.666
Why? Why do I feel this way?

56:12.750 --> 56:15.375
It beats me till today

56:15.458 --> 56:18.416
How cross she gets, how she smiles

56:18.500 --> 56:20.750
Her every mood is unique

56:21.500 --> 56:24.083
She loses her cool like a short fuse

56:24.166 --> 56:27.291
Her smile lights up the world

56:27.375 --> 56:30.166
Her looking up, her looking down

56:30.250 --> 56:32.916
Is like the rising and setting sun

56:33.000 --> 56:36.041
This heart of mine, this breath of mine

56:36.125 --> 56:39.125
They all belong to her

56:50.541 --> 56:51.875
Va Va Voom!

56:51.958 --> 56:53.375
Va Va Va Voom!

56:53.458 --> 56:56.500
There isn't another like her

56:56.583 --> 56:59.458
Va Va Voom! Va Va Va Voom!

56:59.541 --> 57:02.375
Guess what? She's right here

57:02.458 --> 57:05.250
Do I call her friend? Or girlfriend?

57:05.333 --> 57:08.083
Or do I just follow the going trend?

57:08.166 --> 57:11.166
Should I tell her or seal my lips?

57:11.250 --> 57:14.416
It beats me till today

57:14.500 --> 57:17.208
Haven't seen a girl like her

57:17.291 --> 57:19.625
She has such a cool style

57:20.291 --> 57:23.125
I tell her everything

57:23.208 --> 57:25.958
She's the love of my life

57:26.041 --> 57:28.916
Telling her what's in my heart

57:29.000 --> 57:31.916
Makes me lost for words

57:32.000 --> 57:34.916
All that comes to my lips is…

57:35.000 --> 57:37.958
You're just so Va Va Voom!

57:38.041 --> 57:40.583
You're just simply Va Va Voom!

57:40.666 --> 57:43.875
You are just so

57:43.958 --> 57:45.583
Va Va Voom!

57:49.666 --> 57:51.375
We went through our books, Johnny.

57:52.791 --> 57:54.125
We can't pay double the rent.

57:55.625 --> 57:57.000
Suzie has the same problem.

57:57.083 --> 57:58.750
She's giving up the flower shop.

58:00.000 --> 58:01.833
Why are you feeling guilty, you bugger?

58:01.916 --> 58:03.458
You do what you need to.

58:04.333 --> 58:05.958
Even Marge said the same thing.

58:06.041 --> 58:08.708
"Let's sell up and move to Sydney."

58:08.791 --> 58:10.000
Her brother's there, no?

58:10.708 --> 58:11.791
Sell up?

58:13.083 --> 58:15.291
-You're selling the shops?
-Hiram Lodge.

58:15.375 --> 58:18.000
The offer changed from big to buying.

58:18.083 --> 58:20.208
Uncle Hiram is buying this shop?

58:20.291 --> 58:21.916
He wants the whole street.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.791
He'll demolish everything
and make a big plaza.

58:24.875 --> 58:26.541
Please don't sell it.

58:26.625 --> 58:27.916
Betty.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.666
Can you vacate by the end of the week?

58:49.875 --> 58:52.208
Fifth September

58:55.458 --> 59:00.291
And I'd rather not remember

59:02.833 --> 59:08.833
I can feel myself beginning to shrink

59:14.041 --> 59:20.916
Yesterday feels a million miles away…

59:21.000 --> 59:24.208
You go on ahead. I need more time here.

59:24.291 --> 59:26.458
-Why?
-I have to work till dinnertime.

59:26.541 --> 59:27.708
Shoot!

59:28.458 --> 59:29.875
Did you talk to Ronnie?

59:31.083 --> 59:33.750
-Your client is waiting, missy.
-I'm coming.

59:34.750 --> 59:36.125
"Client is waiting, missy!"

59:47.083 --> 59:49.708
Andrews. It's from England.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.500
Mom!

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:09.125
These are tough times.

01:00:09.208 --> 01:00:11.583
God knows how long this café will last.

01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:14.208
I'm going nowhere, Pops.

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:17.083
I'll work here no matter
how much I'm offered.

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:18.166
Excuse me.

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:21.541
Everyone has the right
to move ahead in life.

01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:22.958
Morning, gang!

01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:25.125
Guess who got into Batterton College?

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:27.625
-What?
-Hey! Congratulations!

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:29.500
Well done, Andrews.

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:31.583
-Congratulations!
-Thank you. Thank you.

01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:37.833
-Hi. Hi! Congratulations!
-Thank you.

01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:43.541
Betty, you can't be looking so upset.
This is great for Archie.

01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:48.791
Archie isn't why I'm upset.
Dad's bookstore is going to be shut down.

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:50.125
What? Why?

01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:54.291
Because your Dad has decided to buy
all the shops in the town square,

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:56.375
and replace them with a big plaza.

01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:59.541
-It's not Ronnie's fault.
-When did I say it was?

01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:04.708
Betty, I had no idea.
I'm so sorry you're so upset.

01:01:05.875 --> 01:01:08.791
He's going to lose his job
because of your father.

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:10.916
Hey, that's not fair.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:11.833
Come on, Betts.

01:01:11.916 --> 01:01:13.375
What? It's true.

01:01:13.458 --> 01:01:16.375
Betty, my father was also
just doing his job.

01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:20.583
He always says you can't mix feelings
with business,

01:01:20.666 --> 01:01:22.666
because it's not personal.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:25.583
He doesn't know the meaning of personal.
So what else would he say?

01:01:25.666 --> 01:01:26.708
Excuse me?

01:01:26.791 --> 01:01:29.708
My father is not just selling books,

01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:33.500
he's shaping the thinking
and personalities of children.

01:01:33.583 --> 01:01:35.416
He actually cares about them.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:40.208
Even you must go through his secretary
to talk to your father.

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.708
What just happened?

01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:51.041
I don't know.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.958
Why is she behaving like this?

01:01:54.041 --> 01:01:56.291
She's upset, and why wouldn't she be?

01:01:56.375 --> 01:01:59.291
Everything isn't about profit.
For some people there's more to life.

01:01:59.375 --> 01:02:00.916
Go get stuffed, Jughead!

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
My father is a businessman and I'm not
going to feel guilty about that.

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:06.625
And I'm not going to be apologetic
for my ambition.

01:02:06.708 --> 01:02:08.500
Easy, guys. Relax.

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:10.000
It's all okay.

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:12.541
Really? It's all okay?

01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:17.458
If it's all okay,
why are you leaving Riverdale?

01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:26.541
Welcome to adulthood!

01:02:36.208 --> 01:02:37.458
Is Daddy in a meeting?

01:02:38.208 --> 01:02:39.958
He'll be free by 8:00 this evening.

01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:45.000
Mr. Lodge's office.

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:47.375
Finally, you've given me a card.

01:02:47.458 --> 01:02:48.666
Hi, Ronnie.

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:54.583
Are you free to talk or do I need
an appointment for you as well?

01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:57.791
I always have time for melodrama.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:03:00.333
-Excuse me, ladies. I'll just be a moment.
-Yes, sure.

01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:02.166
Stop looking at my cards.

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.375
Ronnie, honey. What's going on?

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:07.666
Betty's father was evicted
from his bookshop.

01:03:09.291 --> 01:03:10.208
Sad!

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.333
I like the Coopers.

01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:15.958
Their landlord is selling the property
to Daddy.

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:20.791
Darling, in all fairness,
it's the landlord's decision.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:23.416
But, Uncle Hal has lost his livelihood.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:27.166
Cooper is a good man.
He'll find another job.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:30.625
-How do you know?
-Because I'll make sure of it.

01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:36.875
Now we commence the voting for permission
to build a grand hotel

01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:39.958
on the land which is now Green Park.

01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:43.791
I vote Yea.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:47.666
Yea.

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:50.125
Nay.

01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:51.583
I say Yea.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.416
I say Nay.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.833
I'm also a Nay.

01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:08.208
I say Yea.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:17.291
Mrs. Misquitta?

01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:21.833
Up to you now.

01:04:27.333 --> 01:04:30.416
I vote Yea.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.583
What?

01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:36.583
You can't do this to Green Park.

01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:38.625
Five votes in favor of the hotel.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:41.333
Gomes, you can inform the Gazette

01:04:41.416 --> 01:04:44.666
that we're accepting tenders.
The hotel goes through!

01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:05.708
What's going on?

01:05:06.791 --> 01:05:07.958
Tell her, Hal.

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:12.458
You know the new bookstore?

01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:16.583
I've been offered
the assistant manager's post.

01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:17.666
I start tomorrow!

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:18.875
Can you believe it?

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:20.500
Tell her what your salary is.

01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:22.708
Don't show off, Alice.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:28.500
Bless that Hiram Lodge.
He personally recommended me, Betts.

01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:32.916
What's wrong, baby?

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.875
Have you come bearing gifts?

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.208
Chocolate fudge. Your favorite.

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:53.000
-What's the best thing about cake?
-What?

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:55.916
You can eat it at any time.

01:05:56.708 --> 01:06:00.125
You should've seen my Dad's face.
He was so relieved.

01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:03.333
What you did for my Dad,
despite my behavior.

01:06:03.416 --> 01:06:05.041
I don't know how to thank you.

01:06:07.958 --> 01:06:09.291
You could try!

01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:13.833
-Now tell me how much you missed me.
-Lots.

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:18.291
Let's not forget our school motto.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.166
"There is no excellence without labor."

01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:25.750
And now to conclude this assembly…
an announcement.

01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:29.916
From next month, Pop Tates will not
run our school canteen.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:30.958
What?

01:06:31.041 --> 01:06:35.583
The school will introduce pre-packed
lunchboxes from Chaplin & Company.

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:38.541
Thank you.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:45.708
In London we had pre-packed meals.

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:49.708
Ronnie says this is normal practice
in London.

01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:52.375
So? If it happens abroad,
it means it's okay?

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:53.666
That's not what I meant.

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.750
Mr. Chaplin doesn't care
about what we eat.

01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:58.208
-You don't know that.
-It's Pop Tates, Archie!

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.833
Pop makes my burgers with extra cheese.

01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:03.958
No tomatoes for Betty,
no mustard for Moose.

01:07:04.041 --> 01:07:05.541
He has the personal touch.

01:07:06.458 --> 01:07:09.250
Pop Tates's café isn't closing down,
Jughead.

01:07:09.958 --> 01:07:11.791
The school is growing.

01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:14.666
How the funds are used,

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.875
the board will have to take
hard decisions.

01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:19.375
At the cost of what, Miss Grundy?

01:07:21.083 --> 01:07:23.291
Let's discuss that today.

01:07:23.375 --> 01:07:25.125
My Dad wrote an article.

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:30.125
He says all this redevelopment is
in the interest of a few corporations.

01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:33.041
What does that mean?

01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:34.416
Don't take it personally.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.750
This discussion is about
corporate interest vs. public interest.

01:07:40.541 --> 01:07:42.041
What do you think, Archie?

01:07:44.583 --> 01:07:46.166
To be honest, Miss Grundy,

01:07:47.125 --> 01:07:49.666
I don't really think about these things.

01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:53.875
Wait! So, you don't think about your life?

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:55.291
I get a huge kick out of life.

01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:59.708
I just don't think about politics.
What have they got to do with my life?

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:26.791
In every fold of life, there's politics

01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:33.041
Dawn to dusk
Day to night, there's politics

01:08:34.583 --> 01:08:37.625
The teachers in your class

01:08:37.708 --> 01:08:39.458
The lessons they impart…

01:08:39.541 --> 01:08:40.416
No, Reggie.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:45.875
Tell me who decides what those should be

01:08:46.666 --> 01:08:50.458
Should co-ed schools be allowed?

01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:56.750
Can girls wear miniskirts and gad about?

01:08:58.625 --> 01:09:00.708
What's loose? What's tight?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.791
What's wrong? What's right?

01:09:04.833 --> 01:09:10.083
Tell me who do you think decides?

01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:13.791
Archie! Archie!

01:09:13.875 --> 01:09:16.375
You can't just live your life for kicks

01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:19.583
Archie! Archie!

01:09:19.666 --> 01:09:22.041
Everything is politics

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:25.416
Are sports important?

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.666
Or unimportant?

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:31.541
By any chance, is music and dance

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:34.875
As important as physics or chemistry?

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:44.791
Why do I get a driving licence
Only when I'm 18?

01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:50.750
Why are we caged in childhood
Till we're 17?

01:09:52.833 --> 01:09:55.458
All this discipline

01:09:55.541 --> 01:09:58.500
Without rhyme or reason

01:09:58.583 --> 01:10:04.041
Tell me who do you think decides?

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:07.833
Archie! Archie!

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:10.958
You can't just live your life for kicks

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:14.041
Archie! Archie!

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:16.583
Everything is politics

01:10:16.666 --> 01:10:19.625
Now I realize

01:10:19.708 --> 01:10:22.083
Now I get it

01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:25.166
Everything has a hidden meaning

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:28.708
I get the history of this mystery

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:43.750
Archie! Archie!

01:10:43.833 --> 01:10:46.000
I can't just live my life for kicks

01:10:47.166 --> 01:10:49.916
Archie! Archie!

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.875
Everything is politics

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:55.833
Archie! Archie!

01:10:55.916 --> 01:10:58.291
I can't just live my life for kicks

01:10:59.208 --> 01:11:01.750
Archie! Archie!

01:11:01.833 --> 01:11:04.791
Everything. Everything
Everything. Everything

01:11:04.875 --> 01:11:08.125
Everything is politics! Hey, hey!

01:11:11.125 --> 01:11:13.250
"The Viking Symbol Mystery."

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:15.000
-When did he read it?
-I don't know.

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:16.583
Sam just shoots his mouth off!

01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:19.583
-Hardy Boys fans, huh?
-Yeah.

01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:20.750
Then read this too.

01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:23.791
Anglo chap. Remember his name.
Ruskin Bond.

01:11:23.875 --> 01:11:25.083
Ruskin Bond.

01:11:26.291 --> 01:11:28.166
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.041
-Can I have a word with you?
-Sure.

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:35.416
That bookstore in the town square?
That was mine.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.708
-Oh, really?
-Hal's.

01:11:37.791 --> 01:11:40.583
I organized a children's hour every week.

01:11:40.666 --> 01:11:41.875
That's actually a great idea.

01:11:41.958 --> 01:11:43.916
What did you charge?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.166
Nada! All free. Just to instill
a love for books, that's all.

01:11:48.791 --> 01:11:53.458
See, Hal, we want to attract the kind
of customers who'll buy books.

01:11:53.541 --> 01:11:57.916
There's no profit for us
if they come to be entertained.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.833
We've got monthly targets
to achieve, right?

01:12:00.791 --> 01:12:03.166
Yeah? Let me know if there's
anything else though.

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:12.458
Mary…

01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:14.500
-How lovely, Alice.
-Thank you.

01:12:14.583 --> 01:12:15.833
That looks excellent!

01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:16.958
-See you later.
-Bye!

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:18.250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:19.458
Hi, Ethel.

01:12:19.541 --> 01:12:21.041
I hope you're coming tonight.

01:12:21.125 --> 01:12:23.166
Of course, Aunty.
As soon as I get off work.

01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:24.291
Great.

01:12:25.958 --> 01:12:28.125
Oh, dear. I've forgotten my wallet.

01:12:28.875 --> 01:12:31.125
-No credit.
-I'm so sorry.

01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:34.250
-I was in such a rush…
-Don't worry. Pay tomorrow.

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:35.166
Thank you.

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:36.750
Thank you.

01:12:37.916 --> 01:12:40.666
Never interfere between
the clients and me.

01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:44.541
Interfere? That's Aunty Mary.

01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:46.833
Aunty? So what? Must I change the rules?

01:12:46.916 --> 01:12:48.875
Your double salary comes from me.

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:50.875
Now go get the money from her.

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:55.500
What are you looking at, stupid?

01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:56.833
Don't you get it?

01:12:56.916 --> 01:12:58.291
Please don't talk to me like that.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:01.375
No amount of money will get me
being mean to my friend's mother.

01:13:01.458 --> 01:13:02.375
Excuse me.

01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:18.958
Yes? Can I help you?

01:13:19.625 --> 01:13:21.375
Can I please have my job back?

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:25.500
I made a mistake.

01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:28.041
Can you forgive me?

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:31.041
Come.

01:13:34.791 --> 01:13:36.375
Twenty years!

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.125
And I still carry her picture.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.416
You always were a tight arse, Fred.

01:13:46.833 --> 01:13:48.000
In my wallet.

01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:49.541
We believe you.

01:13:51.208 --> 01:13:54.083
When times get rough, I take it out

01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:55.291
and I remind myself

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:57.333
that I can survive anything,

01:13:57.416 --> 01:14:00.666
if I've survived being married to Mary!

01:14:01.416 --> 01:14:03.375
-Very funny, Fred.
-Cheers!

01:14:04.125 --> 01:14:05.208
Give her a kiss!

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:08.416
The kids always get in the way.

01:14:12.958 --> 01:14:15.791
Let's organize something
for Archie's farewell?

01:14:15.875 --> 01:14:17.750
Should I ask Daddy for the Lake House?

01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:18.833
Yes!

01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:22.708
Look who's first in line.

01:14:23.541 --> 01:14:25.375
He loves strawberry shortcake.

01:14:26.791 --> 01:14:29.500
-You make him so nervous.
-Good.

01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:31.541
I quit the salon
and went back to Pam ma'am.

01:14:33.083 --> 01:14:33.916
Good girl.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.416
I'm not your dog, Juggy.

01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:51.166
My heart beats boom-boom for you…

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:52.916
-Come on.
-Not me. You go.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.208
You make me feel like Sunday on a Saturday

01:14:58.375 --> 01:15:02.541
My heart bells ring ding-dong for you

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:07.166
You make me smile like I am on a holiday

01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:12.333
My blue guitar goes ting-ting
For you, my love

01:15:13.666 --> 01:15:17.583
I may not be Sinatra, I'll sing it anyway

01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:22.750
O Ruby, if life were plum pudding

01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:27.833
You'd be the sugar and spice

01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:32.791
O Michael, if life were plum pudding

01:15:34.291 --> 01:15:38.708
You'd be the sweetest surprise…

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.625
Well played, boy!

01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:53.500
I tom-tom my love for you

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.708
You can ring my phone tring-tring
I'm just a call away

01:15:59.541 --> 01:16:03.625
Darling, stop playing ping-pong
With my heart

01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:08.333
I may not be Sinatra, I'll sing it anyway

01:16:09.875 --> 01:16:12.625
O Ruby, if life were plum pudding…

01:16:12.708 --> 01:16:13.791
I wish I had two hearts.

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:22.916
I wish you had one brain.

01:16:24.458 --> 01:16:28.833
It's true. Can't understand
how one can love only one person.

01:16:30.041 --> 01:16:33.416
Perfect topic for your parents'
20th anniversary.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.291
I'm serious, Juggy.

01:16:35.375 --> 01:16:37.750
One should not have to control
how much love one gives.

01:16:37.833 --> 01:16:40.458
And besides, how can you find
everything in one person?

01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:43.750
Imagine if you had to choose between
Paul McCartney and John Lennon.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.666
It's like choosing between rock n' roll…

01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:49.625
I feel the same way…

01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:52.500
about cakes and shakes.

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:54.416
Shut up!

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.625
Where you going?

01:16:56.750 --> 01:17:01.625
-O Ruby, you are my plum pudding
-My plum pudding

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:06.916
No one is sweeter, my love

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.791
-O Michael, you are my plum pudding
-My plum pudding

01:17:12.458 --> 01:17:16.583
Sweeter than sugar, my love

01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:21.750
Sweeter than sugar, my love

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:25.958
Sweeter than sugar

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:29.750
My love

01:17:32.166 --> 01:17:34.750
-Happy anniversary!
-Thank you, Juggy.

01:17:35.708 --> 01:17:37.750
You stay away from my wife!

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:39.416
I'll give you a pasting.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.208
-Want a black eye?
-Hal, calm down!

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:42.750
-Hal!
-You won't be able to read!

01:17:42.833 --> 01:17:45.208
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:49.125
What?

01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:51.458
Green Park will be converted into a hotel?

01:17:53.666 --> 01:17:54.541
Yes.

01:17:55.708 --> 01:17:57.833
The Gazette has to put out
a call for tenders.

01:17:57.916 --> 01:17:59.416
How will they do that?

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.791
They'll reserve a section for residents.

01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:03.583
Riverdale's residents? Or the hotel's?

01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:06.916
You were right, Reg.

01:18:08.166 --> 01:18:09.750
Well, let's look at the bright side.

01:18:09.833 --> 01:18:12.458
We'll attract more tourists, so more jobs.

01:18:12.541 --> 01:18:13.875
Not "hoinga", it's hoga.

01:18:13.958 --> 01:18:15.708
Not "hoga", it's "hongey".

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:17.875
Bloody hell, I never get it right.

01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:20.125
More tourists mean more business
for you, Fred.

01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:21.500
Dad, Green Park--

01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:24.250
Sorry, but not everything
is about profit, Jones.

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:27.875
-Can't we all do something together?
-What can we do, Reg?

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:30.666
Some big people must be behind this.

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.708
People like us don't matter.

01:18:35.541 --> 01:18:37.583
Uncle Ricky,
why don't you talk to the Council?

01:18:38.166 --> 01:18:39.250
I tried.

01:18:39.333 --> 01:18:42.750
Only Esther, Noorani, and Gomes
are against it.

01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:44.833
Money makes the world go round, Mantle.

01:18:44.916 --> 01:18:46.375
It's a really sad reality.

01:18:46.458 --> 01:18:48.541
Yeah. But our bookshop was closed down.

01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:50.625
You should also see
what we can get in return.

01:18:50.708 --> 01:18:53.083
-In return for Green Park?
-Baby.

01:18:53.916 --> 01:18:56.916
That's where we were the day
independence was declared.

01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:00.125
These kids had just been born.

01:19:01.833 --> 01:19:04.583
Their first steps in free India

01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:06.833
were taken in Green Park.

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:11.750
How can you put a price to that, Alice?

01:19:13.333 --> 01:19:16.125
I know. It is what it is, Fred.

01:19:17.708 --> 01:19:18.791
Dad.

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:23.250
I want to interview the Council Head.

01:19:25.166 --> 01:19:27.041
Go ahead. Do it.

01:19:27.125 --> 01:19:28.375
I'm coming with you.

01:19:32.583 --> 01:19:35.666
London, Paris, New York,
I've heard all these places

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:38.666
offer a grand hotel in the heart of town.

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:41.833
And I've heard,
they also have parks that are central.

01:19:43.416 --> 01:19:44.541
You need glasses?

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.791
Why you need this park?

01:19:47.875 --> 01:19:49.833
Everywhere you look, there is greenery.

01:19:49.916 --> 01:19:51.083
Green Park is our history.

01:19:51.166 --> 01:19:53.583
Those are our trees.
That's where we've grown up.

01:19:53.666 --> 01:19:57.083
The hotel will keep a portion of it
as a private garden.

01:19:57.166 --> 01:19:59.625
Everything won't be ripped out. I promise.

01:20:01.166 --> 01:20:02.875
-What?
-Ripped out?

01:20:04.208 --> 01:20:06.666
They plan to cut the trees?

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:08.375
See, the Town Council has passed it.

01:20:08.458 --> 01:20:11.833
And it was the Riverdale folk
who elected this Council.

01:20:11.916 --> 01:20:13.333
It was all democratic.

01:20:13.416 --> 01:20:16.291
What if, after electing the Council,
the people don't agree with them?

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:17.916
Who are these people?

01:20:18.625 --> 01:20:21.000
The Council's decision can be reversed.

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.625
-Really?
-Yes.

01:20:22.708 --> 01:20:26.666
If there's a petition signed by more
than 50 percent of Riverdale's population.

01:20:27.666 --> 01:20:31.083
-What are you talking, Gomes?
-And how many people would that be?

01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:33.041
Four thousand five hundred
should be enough.

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:35.958
Our current population is 8,876.

01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:38.375
And how much time do we have
for this petition?

01:20:38.458 --> 01:20:40.416
Forty-five days
since the Council passed it.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.041
-Forty-five days?
-The whole school will sign it.

01:20:43.125 --> 01:20:45.833
It can only be signed over 18-year-olds.

01:20:45.916 --> 01:20:47.000
Yes!

01:20:48.458 --> 01:20:50.041
Because children don't count.

01:20:51.666 --> 01:20:52.708
Thank you.

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:57.541
Wait. Our parents don't count,
we don't count.

01:20:57.625 --> 01:20:59.333
Who counts in this town?

01:21:00.041 --> 01:21:00.875
I don't know.

01:21:00.958 --> 01:21:03.791
If we let Green Park get destroyed,
other parks will go too.

01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:05.791
Trust me. Not a single tree
will be spared.

01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:08.375
That won't happen.
We can organize a petition.

01:21:08.458 --> 01:21:09.291
And so?

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:12.125
If half of Riverdale's residents sign,

01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:13.416
they can't do anything.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.041
-Is that the law?
-Yes.

01:21:15.916 --> 01:21:18.875
I'm going to write an article
to inform the whole town.

01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:21.208
You think we can reach 4,000 people
through your paper?

01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:23.583
The Gazette goes to every home.

01:21:23.666 --> 01:21:26.166
How do we collect the signatures?

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:28.458
The paper will only carry the article.

01:21:29.125 --> 01:21:32.750
Yes, but at the end of it,
we add instructions.

01:21:32.833 --> 01:21:37.458
"Dear Reader, if you wish to save
Green Park, write a note, sign it,

01:21:37.541 --> 01:21:41.000
and post it to our address." Simple!

01:21:41.083 --> 01:21:42.750
Doiley, you're a genius!

01:21:42.833 --> 01:21:43.916
Thank you.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.750
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

01:21:45.833 --> 01:21:50.333
I'm glad Dilly isn't going with Archie
to London, otherwise we'd lose the park.

01:21:50.416 --> 01:21:53.125
-Shut up, Jughead.
-It's true.

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.541
So, Archie? All set?

01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:55.958
Yes, Uncle Ben, all set.

01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:59.083
Splendid. I'm going to be at the airport
to pick you up.

01:21:59.166 --> 01:22:00.708
Yeah, that'll be great. Thank you.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.583
And your aunt,
she's redone the room for you.

01:22:02.666 --> 01:22:04.500
Can I get you anything from here?

01:22:04.583 --> 01:22:06.458
Yes, please. Some kulkuls.

01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:07.875
Kulkuls, okay.

01:22:07.958 --> 01:22:10.000
And some spicy salt fish pickle.

01:22:10.083 --> 01:22:12.500
Spicy salt fish pickle.
Okay, I'll tell Mom.

01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:13.666
Are you excited?

01:22:14.375 --> 01:22:16.291
Yeah. I am excited.

01:22:16.375 --> 01:22:18.125
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:20.333
There's nothing left for you
in Riverdale, Archie.

01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:23.291
You come soon.
Your life is about to start.

01:22:33.541 --> 01:22:34.541
Reginald Mantle.

01:22:35.875 --> 01:22:38.166
-This is very, very good.
-So you'll print it?

01:22:40.708 --> 01:22:43.208
Dennis, move the other articles.

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.291
Monday morning, front page.

01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:47.666
My son has come of age.

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:48.791
Andrews!

01:22:49.541 --> 01:22:50.708
It's done!

01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:54.791
For a moment I thought he was
giving me a jokes column.

01:22:54.875 --> 01:22:56.958
You wouldn't print it.
He's not very funny.

01:22:57.041 --> 01:22:59.916
You know one day you'll both realize
the value of a comedian.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.500
When will it be printed, Uncle?

01:23:01.583 --> 01:23:04.500
Come back from your holiday,
then it'll be in the paper.

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:10.916
Welcome to the "I love Archie"
farewell weekend.

01:23:12.708 --> 01:23:16.041
We have… T-shirts.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.458
And some goggles.

01:23:20.416 --> 01:23:23.708
Dilly, please remember,
camera always on the left profile

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:25.875
and at this height.

01:23:25.958 --> 01:23:28.833
So we'll just have to find ways
for you to shoot yourself then.

01:23:29.875 --> 01:23:30.791
I have!

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:34.041
Oh, you have a film camera
and you still don't know that

01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:36.791
"The cinema is truth 24 times a second."

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:39.041
Godard said that.

01:23:39.125 --> 01:23:41.416
How you look is not important,

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.375
what's important is how you feel.

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:49.916
Thank you.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.791
Thank you!

01:24:02.083 --> 01:24:04.625
They're waiting for me at the golf course.

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:06.125
This better be good, Dennis.

01:24:08.375 --> 01:24:10.333
-Yeah!
-Here we go.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:16.958
Hey, Reg, I jumped in first.

01:24:17.041 --> 01:24:20.083
-The water looks cold.
-You can tell by looking at it? Wow!

01:24:21.625 --> 01:24:22.958
Betty, just push him in.

01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:26.791
-What?
-Best idea since sliced bread.

01:24:30.083 --> 01:24:32.958
-Why are you guys after me?
-Because you're a scaredy-cat.

01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:34.916
What? No.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Just come in, Reggie. It's lovely.

01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:38.958
Truth or dare?

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:41.083
Say you're a scaredy cat or jump in!

01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:47.041
Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat.

01:24:57.583 --> 01:24:58.625
I choose dare!

01:24:59.333 --> 01:25:02.125
I dare you to give me a beat right now.

01:25:02.708 --> 01:25:04.958
-Or kiss one of the girls.
-Excuse me?

01:25:05.583 --> 01:25:06.541
That's not funny.

01:25:09.166 --> 01:25:10.583
I don't have my drumsticks here.

01:25:13.583 --> 01:25:14.625
Exactly!

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.958
Are you making that sound with your mouth?

01:25:28.375 --> 01:25:31.750
-He's a musical genius.
-He's a weirdo.

01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:34.541
Good save, Juggy.

01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:36.208
Now, Dilly, your turn.

01:25:36.291 --> 01:25:37.250
Truth.

01:25:37.333 --> 01:25:40.333
Tell us one secret about you
that no one knows.

01:25:40.958 --> 01:25:41.958
Or dare?

01:25:42.541 --> 01:25:45.875
-Do 50 push-ups.
-Please! I don't want to see that.

01:25:45.958 --> 01:25:48.416
Dilly, your dare is…

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.541
you throw your camera towards us,

01:25:50.625 --> 01:25:52.458
and the girl who catches it, keeps it.

01:25:54.416 --> 01:25:56.583
Come on, Dilly. Truth or dare?

01:25:56.666 --> 01:25:59.708
-Truth.
-No, dare! I want that camera.

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:03.250
What?

01:26:03.333 --> 01:26:04.708
No, Dilly, you love that camera.

01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:06.625
Tell us a secret and keep that camera.

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:13.291
Why you thinking so much?

01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:15.333
Everyone has secrets. Tell us.

01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:18.458
Come on, Dilly.

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:21.250
What's wrong?

01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:29.750
What happened?

01:26:38.291 --> 01:26:41.125
What happened, Dilly? Are you okay?

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:43.333
What is it, Dilly?
It's just a stupid game.

01:26:43.416 --> 01:26:44.833
You don't have to answer it.

01:26:44.916 --> 01:26:49.583
No. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's mood.
Let's just go. I'm so sorry.

01:26:50.333 --> 01:26:53.333
Don't be crazy. We're all friends here.

01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:55.541
I know.

01:26:55.625 --> 01:26:58.083
It's your party,
you can cry if you want to.

01:26:58.166 --> 01:26:59.416
I'm sorry.

01:27:11.791 --> 01:27:13.000
Are you awake?

01:27:13.875 --> 01:27:16.000
My eyes are open, Reggie.

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.583
I wanted to say something.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:24.958
You're not a scaredy-cat like me.

01:27:25.875 --> 01:27:27.875
You are the bravest guy I know.

01:27:32.458 --> 01:27:35.916
And… I know what you feel for me.

01:27:38.333 --> 01:27:39.791
And I also know

01:27:41.208 --> 01:27:42.958
how tough it must be for you

01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:47.041
that I don't feel the same.

01:27:48.416 --> 01:27:50.708
I just wanted to say that

01:27:51.541 --> 01:27:52.833
I'm your friend.

01:27:54.208 --> 01:27:55.833
And always will be.

01:27:57.583 --> 01:28:00.291
And don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.166
It's your story to tell.

01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:04.083
Okay?

01:28:11.291 --> 01:28:12.250
Good night.

01:28:12.333 --> 01:28:13.625
Good night.

01:28:17.416 --> 01:28:19.750
"Torn down in the name of development."

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.916
Where is Ricky Mantle?

01:29:11.041 --> 01:29:12.208
Good morning.

01:29:12.291 --> 01:29:14.791
It's a bit early to look this foxy.

01:29:15.458 --> 01:29:18.166
I thought Reggie would be up before you.

01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:19.958
He's losing his touch.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:24.125
You weren't waiting for Reggie.

01:29:24.208 --> 01:29:27.375
Really? Then who was I waiting for?

01:29:38.666 --> 01:29:40.125
Was I right?

01:29:46.458 --> 01:29:47.416
Come.

01:29:57.875 --> 01:30:00.625
-Morning, Betts.
-What's so good about this morning?

01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:03.833
Hi.

01:30:09.875 --> 01:30:11.375
Betty just bit my head off.

01:30:11.458 --> 01:30:13.375
What? Betty doesn't bite.

01:30:13.458 --> 01:30:15.833
You must've done something to upset her.

01:30:17.166 --> 01:30:19.500
All aboard, please. All aboard!

01:30:19.583 --> 01:30:22.166
Yes, Smithers. We're sailing away soon.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.250
Anchors aweigh, old chap.

01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:36.833
Burning ochre is

01:30:36.916 --> 01:30:39.291
The color of October

01:30:39.375 --> 01:30:45.875
And I think I finally understand

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.083
Maybe now my heart will hush

01:30:52.166 --> 01:30:56.875
I can let go of my crush

01:30:56.958 --> 01:31:02.875
Because you will never take…

01:31:04.916 --> 01:31:09.375
My hand

01:31:40.291 --> 01:31:42.583
The Town Council does not want a dispute.

01:31:42.666 --> 01:31:43.666
What dispute?

01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:46.333
We're only informing people that
they have a choice.

01:31:46.416 --> 01:31:47.750
I know, Reg, but…

01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:51.125
You were the one who said
I must write something meaningful.

01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:54.416
-You said it was good, Dad.
-And it is.

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.458
So then?

01:31:55.541 --> 01:31:57.958
Then it turns out Hiram Lodge
is behind this hotel.

01:31:59.041 --> 01:32:00.000
What?

01:32:01.166 --> 01:32:03.416
The Gazette's largest advertising revenue

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.958
comes from Lodge Industries.

01:32:05.041 --> 01:32:07.541
If I print your article,
the money will stop,

01:32:07.625 --> 01:32:09.500
he will shut us down.
The publication closes.

01:32:09.583 --> 01:32:12.125
-He said that?
-Yes, he did.

01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:16.750
I have to look at the bigger picture, son.

01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:18.958
What about the free press
grandpa fought for?

01:32:19.041 --> 01:32:20.958
You got scared of Mr. Lodge.

01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:23.708
Where's that social responsibility
you wanted to arouse in me?

01:32:34.333 --> 01:32:35.666
See you, Uncle Ricky.

01:32:46.958 --> 01:32:49.166
-Can we talk?
-Not now.

01:32:50.875 --> 01:32:52.041
Is everything okay, Betts?

01:32:58.708 --> 01:32:59.625
She's here.

01:33:04.166 --> 01:33:05.041
Hi!

01:33:05.916 --> 01:33:08.958
-So your Dad is building the hotel?
-What are you talking about?

01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:11.250
-He's gonna destroy Green Park.
-No, he's not.

01:33:11.333 --> 01:33:13.500
He stopped my article from going to press.

01:33:14.083 --> 01:33:16.208
-He threatened my father.
-What?

01:33:16.291 --> 01:33:18.000
Did you tell him
about the article, Ronnie?

01:33:18.083 --> 01:33:20.291
No. I knew nothing about it.

01:33:21.375 --> 01:33:22.583
How dare he accuse me!

01:33:23.416 --> 01:33:25.666
Who else could've told your Dad?

01:33:40.791 --> 01:33:42.916
He's on a call, darling.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:43.916
Ronnie!

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.833
No, no, that sounds perfect.

01:33:46.541 --> 01:33:50.833
In fact, I was thinking
we could announce it at Christmas.

01:33:51.583 --> 01:33:52.833
I'm busy, darling.

01:33:53.458 --> 01:33:54.458
Yes.

01:33:57.791 --> 01:33:59.500
Look, I'm going to have to call you back.

01:34:05.833 --> 01:34:07.916
-No school today?
-You threatened Uncle Ricky?

01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:10.583
I did no such thing.

01:34:10.666 --> 01:34:12.833
Then why didn't he print Reggie's article?

01:34:12.916 --> 01:34:16.208
I merely expressed my point of view.
He did what he thought right.

01:34:17.041 --> 01:34:20.125
Is it right to destroy the park
and make an ugly hotel instead?

01:34:20.208 --> 01:34:22.416
Yes, because it'll help a lot of people.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:23.500
It'll help you.

01:34:24.791 --> 01:34:26.166
This is Green Park, Dad.

01:34:27.083 --> 01:34:29.791
Do you care about anything besides money?

01:34:29.875 --> 01:34:32.125
Excuse me, missy! Mind your step.

01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:35.291
It's thanks to my money
that you travel the world,

01:34:35.375 --> 01:34:37.833
do your shopping, throw your parties.

01:34:37.916 --> 01:34:41.250
Have you any idea
what your watch costs? You brat!

01:34:41.333 --> 01:34:43.708
Where do you think all this comes from?

01:34:45.708 --> 01:34:48.458
For God's sake, Ronnie, grow up.

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:51.083
One day this will all belong to you.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.541
Besides, this is business,
it's not personal.

01:34:55.625 --> 01:34:59.083
My friends hate me because of you.

01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:02.250
So I'm sorry, but it is personal.

01:35:03.958 --> 01:35:05.916
Then get new friends.

01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:24.833
Thank you for coming.

01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:26.958
What do you want?

01:35:27.041 --> 01:35:28.458
I want to say sorry.

01:35:28.541 --> 01:35:31.041
-For what?
-Whatever I've done.

01:35:32.208 --> 01:35:33.916
Why are you angry, Betts?

01:35:36.541 --> 01:35:38.875
I'm not angry, I'm just sad.

01:35:41.333 --> 01:35:43.041
Can you please tell me why?

01:35:44.916 --> 01:35:46.625
You're my oldest friend, Betts.

01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:50.666
It feels strange
when you don't talk to me.

01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:01.791
Can you please tell me what's wrong?

01:36:01.875 --> 01:36:04.500
Is it about Ronnie and me?

01:36:06.916 --> 01:36:09.583
The connection between you
and Ronnie is special.

01:36:09.666 --> 01:36:11.833
I shouldn't have come in between.

01:36:14.208 --> 01:36:16.875
Ronnie can't have a special connection
with anyone.

01:36:16.958 --> 01:36:20.625
-That's not true.
-I'm serious. She only loves herself.

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:21.625
Hey, enough!

01:36:21.708 --> 01:36:24.208
I know she may be spoilt,
but she has a big heart.

01:36:25.458 --> 01:36:28.750
No matter what Reggie says,
I don't believe it.

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:31.166
It's impossible that she knew.

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:32.958
-Really?
-Yes.

01:36:33.041 --> 01:36:36.791
She thinks Green Park is as important
as we all do.

01:36:36.875 --> 01:36:39.958
Remember? She had her
tenth birthday party here.

01:36:40.875 --> 01:36:44.375
How could I forget? It was the first time
we went on that giant wheel.

01:36:44.458 --> 01:36:47.250
And her favorite teacher? Mrs. Pearson.

01:36:47.333 --> 01:36:49.416
She held her classes in this park.

01:36:49.833 --> 01:36:52.541
-In the park?
-How can you forget?

01:36:53.208 --> 01:36:54.916
Here's your passport.

01:36:56.458 --> 01:36:58.416
Please be responsible with your money.

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.875
Yes, Dad. I'll get a part-time job too.

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:03.125
First pass the exam.

01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:06.583
Did you ever think of leaving Riverdale?

01:37:06.666 --> 01:37:08.000
I thought more of staying.

01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.000
How come you and Uncle Ben
are so different?

01:37:13.958 --> 01:37:16.416
Your grandfather always asked
the same question.

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:18.791
-"The" Richard Andrews?
-Yes.

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.000
The Richie!

01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:23.583
How he loved this country.

01:37:23.666 --> 01:37:28.000
He used to say,
"Every Englishman owes India."

01:37:28.875 --> 01:37:30.000
And he meant it.

01:37:30.833 --> 01:37:32.708
When the time came for him to return,

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:36.166
he stayed back, to give back.

01:37:37.291 --> 01:37:40.166
-By starting a travel agency?
-Yes.

01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:43.500
He made money off people
who were heading back,

01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:46.875
and give it to those who had nothing.

01:37:48.375 --> 01:37:52.083
Juggy's mom said Grandpa opened a school
for kids in her village.

01:37:52.583 --> 01:37:53.583
Yes.

01:37:54.375 --> 01:37:56.500
We still donate to that school.

01:37:56.583 --> 01:37:58.916
Really? I didn't know that.

01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:02.625
I was hoping you'd do the same after me.

01:38:03.458 --> 01:38:07.208
But you think like your Uncle Ben. Right?

01:38:07.291 --> 01:38:09.791
The grass is always greener
on the other side.

01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:17.375
You happy you stayed?

01:38:22.125 --> 01:38:23.666
This is our home, Archie.

01:38:25.458 --> 01:38:26.666
We're a minority.

01:38:27.541 --> 01:38:29.125
But this is our country.

01:38:32.375 --> 01:38:33.708
If we had all left,

01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:38.625
who would remember the Anglo-Indians?

01:38:40.916 --> 01:38:43.166
It would be as though
we had never existed.

01:39:33.958 --> 01:39:35.541
Pat the mud down, Archie.

01:39:36.833 --> 01:39:37.875
Well done!

01:40:18.166 --> 01:40:19.875
A chocolate milkshake, Pops.

01:40:21.375 --> 01:40:24.416
Double scoop of vanilla.
With a cherry on top?

01:40:50.375 --> 01:40:51.208
Dad…

01:40:52.666 --> 01:40:54.375
I need to talk to you.

01:40:55.875 --> 01:40:57.250
I don't want to go to London.

01:40:59.125 --> 01:41:01.458
Why? What has happened?

01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:03.416
There could be a way to save Green Park,

01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:05.666
and I can't leave knowing
I could've done something.

01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:07.958
Okay! But all arrangements have been made.

01:41:08.041 --> 01:41:09.500
Can we rearrange it?

01:41:10.833 --> 01:41:11.875
Please, Fred.

01:41:14.125 --> 01:41:15.416
Today I realized,

01:41:16.583 --> 01:41:18.375
the grass isn't greener on the other side.

01:41:20.458 --> 01:41:22.625
The grass is greener where you water it.

01:41:24.083 --> 01:41:25.750
Isn't that what you meant?

01:41:28.333 --> 01:41:29.666
This is my home.

01:41:31.416 --> 01:41:32.708
I can't leave.

01:41:43.833 --> 01:41:46.666
Come, hear my story

01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:48.125
Listen up

01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:56.916
These are my words, listen up

01:41:58.541 --> 01:42:04.000
The humming you hear

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.958
Is the tune of the youth, listen up

01:42:13.166 --> 01:42:16.458
This is my story

01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:18.333
Listen up

01:42:19.916 --> 01:42:22.791
You can't ignore me

01:42:22.875 --> 01:42:25.416
Listen up

01:42:26.958 --> 01:42:31.708
All my impossible dreams…

01:42:31.791 --> 01:42:35.125
Not interested. Please leave. Out!

01:42:38.625 --> 01:42:44.958
In ever-changing waves

01:42:45.041 --> 01:42:47.708
This life flows, listen up

01:42:47.791 --> 01:42:51.583
Listen up

01:42:51.666 --> 01:42:58.000
It keeps telling us

01:42:58.083 --> 01:43:00.583
To feel the rhythm

01:43:00.666 --> 01:43:03.625
Listen up

01:43:03.708 --> 01:43:07.375
Listen up…

01:43:12.583 --> 01:43:13.958
So it wasn't Ronnie?

01:43:15.708 --> 01:43:18.083
It was Dennis,
he's a reporter at the Gazette.

01:43:18.166 --> 01:43:20.458
Dad found out he was on
Uncle Hiram's payroll.

01:43:20.541 --> 01:43:22.333
You guys accused her for nothing.

01:43:22.916 --> 01:43:23.833
Yeah.

01:43:26.166 --> 01:43:27.500
Can we see Veronica?

01:43:27.583 --> 01:43:30.541
Miss Lodge is out on a trip
with her mother.

01:43:30.625 --> 01:43:32.208
Thank you.

01:43:42.541 --> 01:43:44.083
Have you spoken to Veronica?

01:43:48.291 --> 01:43:52.375
Here come the bells jingling

01:43:54.708 --> 01:43:57.750
What do you mean?
You are not going to sign?

01:43:57.833 --> 01:43:59.083
Hiram Lodge got me the job.

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:01.791
It wouldn't be gracious to go
against him, baby.

01:44:02.833 --> 01:44:06.125
This is my story, listen up

01:44:07.916 --> 01:44:13.708
They say I'm young
And I've got nowhere to be

01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:19.583
I say there's so much I can do

01:44:19.666 --> 01:44:22.625
Tradin' my goodies for the grass

01:44:22.708 --> 01:44:25.208
Under my feet

01:44:25.291 --> 01:44:29.500
Making a greener world for you

01:44:29.583 --> 01:44:34.125
Listen up!

01:44:46.666 --> 01:44:49.958
-Merry Christmas, Nanny.
-Merry Christmas, Veronica baby.

01:44:50.041 --> 01:44:51.458
I hope you like your gift.

01:44:51.541 --> 01:44:53.500
-God bless you.
-Thank you.

01:44:53.583 --> 01:44:56.416
-Merry Christmas, Miss Lodge.
-Merry Christmas, Smithers.

01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:57.500
Where's Mama?

01:44:57.583 --> 01:45:00.666
Your parents left early this morning
to make it in time

01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:03.375
for the Governor's lunch in Mussoorie.

01:45:04.125 --> 01:45:05.000
Mussoorie?

01:45:05.083 --> 01:45:07.375
Mrs. Lodge asked you not to wait for them,

01:45:07.458 --> 01:45:10.208
and to go ahead and open your gifts.

01:45:11.666 --> 01:45:13.000
They'll be back soon.

01:45:17.458 --> 01:45:21.458
Would you like to invite
your friends over for lunch?

01:45:22.291 --> 01:45:23.708
We could cook up a storm.

01:45:50.083 --> 01:45:52.958
Wow! That looks delicious.
You've started making trifles, Betts?

01:45:53.041 --> 01:45:56.041
-No, my mom made that.
-Wow, yummy! Thank you.

01:45:56.125 --> 01:45:57.041
You're welcome.

01:45:58.625 --> 01:45:59.541
Ronnie!

01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:26.875
Your house looks so lovely.

01:46:27.666 --> 01:46:28.750
Merry Christmas, Ronnie.

01:46:28.833 --> 01:46:30.791
Merry Christmas, Uncle Hal.

01:46:30.875 --> 01:46:32.833
Ronnie will have lunch with us.

01:46:32.916 --> 01:46:34.458
How wonderful!

01:46:34.541 --> 01:46:36.458
But first your Christmas gift.

01:46:39.375 --> 01:46:40.750
-Welcome home.
-Thank you.

01:46:40.833 --> 01:46:43.750
Daddy, where's Ronnie's gift?
I left it here.

01:46:43.833 --> 01:46:46.500
Blessed we are to have you, Veronica.

01:46:46.583 --> 01:46:48.791
Merry Christmas, my love.

01:46:50.708 --> 01:46:52.666
Some milk and bickies
till the table is set.

01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:54.416
We are 17 years old, Dad!

01:46:57.791 --> 01:46:58.791
Come.

01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:03.875
You are so lucky, Betts.

01:47:04.791 --> 01:47:05.875
So are you.

01:47:05.958 --> 01:47:08.458
We all get good and bad in our lunchbox.

01:47:09.958 --> 01:47:12.333
The boys are really ashamed
they doubted you.

01:47:12.416 --> 01:47:14.416
You could really help save the park.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.375
Thank you for believing me.

01:47:17.333 --> 01:47:18.625
For always and ever.

01:47:27.875 --> 01:47:30.541
I have something to confess.

01:47:34.875 --> 01:47:36.250
I kissed Archie.

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:38.708
You did what?

01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:41.708
I'm sorry, Ron. I didn't know
you still had feelings for him.

01:47:42.625 --> 01:47:45.166
-When was this?
-The night of my birthday.

01:47:48.666 --> 01:47:51.375
I thought, after you had left,

01:47:51.458 --> 01:47:53.000
things had changed.

01:47:53.083 --> 01:47:55.750
And you said you weren't
interested in Archie…

01:47:55.833 --> 01:47:56.916
Your birthday?

01:47:58.250 --> 01:48:00.208
Why didn't you tell me, Betts?

01:48:00.291 --> 01:48:03.166
I was guilty.
I'm sorry, it was just wrong.

01:48:04.875 --> 01:48:07.583
When I saw you together at Lake House,

01:48:07.666 --> 01:48:10.083
it was obvious you two are in love.

01:48:11.875 --> 01:48:14.333
Archie doesn't know the meaning of love.

01:48:16.208 --> 01:48:18.166
I should've told you before.

01:48:18.250 --> 01:48:23.000
Yes, if you had, I wouldn't have
kissed him at Lake House.

01:48:24.791 --> 01:48:26.541
I wouldn't have come in the way.

01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:44.041
I always felt like you had a crush on him.

01:48:44.666 --> 01:48:49.125
And sometimes I used to worry
that I'd lose him to you.

01:48:50.083 --> 01:48:52.916
-To me?
-You're the only girl I've ever envied.

01:48:53.916 --> 01:48:58.208
You're kind and generous and friendly.

01:48:58.291 --> 01:49:00.791
Everyone loves you, Betty Cooper.

01:49:01.958 --> 01:49:03.875
And you're as cute as a button.

01:49:06.583 --> 01:49:08.291
I've never felt that way.

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:09.500
You should!

01:49:09.583 --> 01:49:12.291
Instead of focusing on
what a boy thinks of you.

01:49:13.708 --> 01:49:15.625
How dare he play us both!

01:49:15.708 --> 01:49:17.666
You think he's playing us both,

01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:21.208
or is he actually just confused?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.750
There's only one weirdo
who can answer that.

01:49:25.541 --> 01:49:27.208
Archie? Two-time?

01:49:27.958 --> 01:49:29.416
How would I know?

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:31.333
Because no one knows him better.

01:49:31.416 --> 01:49:32.333
Who told you that?

01:49:32.416 --> 01:49:35.333
I did! Now spit it out. What's his game?

01:49:37.041 --> 01:49:39.166
I have to collect petitions.

01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:41.416
-I'm getting late, I must go.
-Sit…

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:42.500
down.

01:49:44.166 --> 01:49:47.250
-And put your hands behind your back.
-Why?

01:49:50.166 --> 01:49:53.041
What the hell?
You guys joined the police force?

01:49:53.125 --> 01:49:54.916
Those are my mother's.

01:50:00.333 --> 01:50:01.666
Are you going to murder me?

01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:03.041
Maybe.

01:50:15.208 --> 01:50:16.291
What's going on?

01:50:18.333 --> 01:50:20.166
What's on the menu, Smithers?

01:50:20.958 --> 01:50:22.833
Goat trotters with bread.

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.708
Ball curry and rice.

01:50:24.791 --> 01:50:26.458
Chicken liver pie.

01:50:26.541 --> 01:50:27.750
Roast quail.

01:50:27.833 --> 01:50:29.333
Meat and potatoes.

01:50:29.416 --> 01:50:32.791
And Master Jughead's favorite,
pork vindaloo.

01:50:34.333 --> 01:50:35.541
Thank you, Smithers.

01:50:39.375 --> 01:50:43.583
Tell us the truth or watch us eat dinner.

01:50:43.666 --> 01:50:45.333
Archie loves you both.

01:50:45.416 --> 01:50:47.500
He's really confused. He can't choose.

01:50:47.583 --> 01:50:49.000
Who is he to choose?

01:50:49.083 --> 01:50:50.875
No, no, you're absolutely right.

01:50:50.958 --> 01:50:52.083
He messed with us, Juggy.

01:50:52.166 --> 01:50:54.958
I warned him when you find out,
it'll be bad.

01:50:55.041 --> 01:50:58.083
He didn't listen to me.
You girls are scary.

01:50:58.166 --> 01:50:59.875
-Scary?
-Yeah.

01:51:00.541 --> 01:51:02.083
-Poor guy.
-Poor guy!

01:51:03.208 --> 01:51:05.166
It's a real problem.
He can't help himself.

01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:06.833
He can't live without either of you.

01:51:06.916 --> 01:51:09.333
That's why he wrote the Founders' Ball
song for you both.

01:51:09.416 --> 01:51:10.375
What?

01:51:13.916 --> 01:51:15.875
Can I join you for dinner now?

01:51:24.333 --> 01:51:25.458
Archie.

01:51:28.083 --> 01:51:29.625
You're having a dream.

01:51:38.375 --> 01:51:40.583
And here is your nightmare.

01:51:43.875 --> 01:51:45.083
Ronnie?

01:51:45.166 --> 01:51:47.041
The last time I checked, yes!

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.666
-I owe you a big apology.
-Yes, you do.

01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:52.833
I should've known you were
telling the truth.

01:51:52.916 --> 01:51:55.250
And we should've known
you're a number-one liar.

01:51:55.333 --> 01:51:57.666
Betty, what's going on?

01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:59.000
You tell us.

01:51:59.083 --> 01:52:02.416
Why are you creating problems
between us, Archiekins?

01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:03.750
Problems?

01:52:06.958 --> 01:52:09.750
I know what this looks like,
but I never lied to either of you.

01:52:09.833 --> 01:52:11.208
I always told the truth.

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:13.875
Like you wrote that song for me.

01:52:13.958 --> 01:52:15.708
"Va Va Voom." For Betty!

01:52:15.791 --> 01:52:17.541
And for me too.

01:52:18.958 --> 01:52:19.958
Jughead told you?

01:52:21.875 --> 01:52:23.708
-True friend.
-What?

01:52:23.791 --> 01:52:26.916
-Why would you do that?
-I don't know, I really like both of you.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.083
That's so sweet.

01:52:28.166 --> 01:52:30.916
I'm really sorry.
I don't want to hurt anyone.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.666
Great. We don't want to hurt
each other either.

01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:36.291
No one can come between Betts and me.

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:38.541
It's just not worth it.

01:52:38.625 --> 01:52:40.083
You saying I'm not worth it?

01:52:40.166 --> 01:52:41.458
Sort of.

01:52:41.541 --> 01:52:45.250
We're one gang, Arch.
And you're a wonderful best friend.

01:52:46.083 --> 01:52:49.000
We should keep it at that.
Don't you think?

01:52:49.083 --> 01:52:50.333
Better for all.

01:52:50.416 --> 01:52:54.000
-Don't look so heartbroken.
-He'll be fine.

01:52:54.666 --> 01:52:56.166
Hearts don't break, right?

01:52:56.250 --> 01:52:57.958
They just fracture.

01:52:58.041 --> 01:52:59.666
And time heals everything.

01:53:01.458 --> 01:53:03.083
Change your line, Archie!

01:53:03.166 --> 01:53:04.166
Bye.

01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:07.166
And don't try it on again!
Or we'll kill you.

01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:09.541
See you at the park meeting tomorrow.

01:53:09.625 --> 01:53:11.583
You just got popped, Andrews.

01:53:18.375 --> 01:53:19.541
Here.

01:53:27.666 --> 01:53:30.000
-Hi, Ronnie.
-Hi.

01:53:30.083 --> 01:53:32.041
-Hi.
-Welcome back!

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:35.916
Hey.

01:53:38.833 --> 01:53:40.125
I'm sorry.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.458
And I'm Ronnie. Nice to meet you.

01:53:47.666 --> 01:53:48.708
Betts.

01:53:49.583 --> 01:53:50.958
Thanks for sparing his life.

01:53:51.541 --> 01:53:52.875
Don't be weird, Juggy.

01:53:52.958 --> 01:53:55.666
You've done more than enough, Jughead.

01:53:56.250 --> 01:53:57.625
True friend!

01:53:59.083 --> 01:54:00.041
Come, sit.

01:54:00.125 --> 01:54:01.291
So?

01:54:01.375 --> 01:54:02.583
How's it going?

01:54:03.125 --> 01:54:05.333
Final count, 1,200 signatures.

01:54:05.916 --> 01:54:06.833
That's all?

01:54:06.916 --> 01:54:08.416
We're still 3,300 short.

01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:11.625
-That's it. We're out of time.
-She's right.

01:54:12.333 --> 01:54:13.625
My mother said,

01:54:13.708 --> 01:54:16.500
the work in the park will start on Monday.

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:18.416
Only four days left.

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.791
We haven't got half the number we need.

01:54:20.875 --> 01:54:22.833
We have to do something. We can't give up.

01:54:22.916 --> 01:54:24.541
We must go door-to-door.

01:54:24.625 --> 01:54:26.750
Ask all the grown-ups
for their signatures.

01:54:26.833 --> 01:54:28.208
I may have an idea.

01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:30.916
There are two types of adults.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.958
Young adults and the ones
trying to be young.

01:54:33.041 --> 01:54:33.875
Funny.

01:54:33.958 --> 01:54:36.833
-I think we can draw them in.
-"Teen Movie Draws Adults?"

01:54:36.916 --> 01:54:39.916
-Meaning?
-Let's invite all the adults to one place.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
You know what? We can have a fest.

01:54:42.083 --> 01:54:44.000
-I love fests.
-Yes!

01:54:44.083 --> 01:54:45.375
Should we do it in the park?

01:54:45.458 --> 01:54:47.375
How will we invite them?

01:54:47.458 --> 01:54:50.416
We'll have the same problem
of not reaching enough people.

01:54:57.583 --> 01:54:59.041
Edison said,

01:54:59.125 --> 01:55:01.083
"The person who succeeds is the one

01:55:01.166 --> 01:55:04.708
who, after failing a thousand times,
tries once more."

01:55:04.791 --> 01:55:10.000
Did Edison also say how to reach
a thousand people in one go?

01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:13.875
He did. The radio.

01:55:14.625 --> 01:55:17.750
-Edison invented the radio.
-No, that was Marconi. But who cares!

01:55:17.833 --> 01:55:19.416
Let's use the radio.

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:22.458
-Moose, you're a genius!
-Thanks.

01:55:22.541 --> 01:55:23.875
Where are you going?

01:55:24.916 --> 01:55:27.458
Who's gonna let us on Akashvani?

01:55:27.541 --> 01:55:29.333
Who said anything about Akashvani?

01:55:29.416 --> 01:55:32.000
-So then?
-We can try Dilton-vani. Come!

01:55:33.291 --> 01:55:36.583
-What is Dilton-vani?
-Let's go.

01:55:38.625 --> 01:55:41.375
Now we just need to see if it works.

01:55:42.083 --> 01:55:43.541
You made a radio?

01:55:43.625 --> 01:55:45.416
You made a radio?

01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.125
Wow! It's a radio.

01:55:47.208 --> 01:55:50.916
You only told Moose about it?

01:55:52.708 --> 01:55:53.916
Is it legal?

01:55:55.958 --> 01:55:59.083
Come on, Hedy Lamarr. Show us your stuff.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.875
Wow, Dilly!

01:56:13.625 --> 01:56:17.291
Godrej Cinthol Soap.
India's only deodorant soap.

01:56:20.458 --> 01:56:22.125
Good morning, Riverdale!

01:56:22.208 --> 01:56:23.625
I am your secret Santa.

01:56:23.708 --> 01:56:26.416
I'm a little late showing up.

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.750
Better to be Mr. Late than a late mister!

01:56:30.791 --> 01:56:31.916
No more funny guy…

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.416
because I'm sure you're all aware

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.291
the future of our Green Park is in danger.

01:56:36.375 --> 01:56:38.166
But some kids just won't have it.

01:56:38.250 --> 01:56:41.416
With me is 17-year-old,
Archie Andrews from Riverdale High.

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.375
Archie, what do you have to say?

01:56:47.791 --> 01:56:50.291
Hello, everybody.
I'm from the Class of 1964.

01:56:50.833 --> 01:56:54.291
All I want to say…
just talking isn't enough.

01:56:54.375 --> 01:56:58.041
The time has come for us
to come together and act.

01:56:58.583 --> 01:57:02.333
Like you say, Archie, we all have
to come together and act.

01:57:02.416 --> 01:57:03.666
Tell me where we must meet.

01:57:04.916 --> 01:57:05.875
Green Park.

01:57:06.916 --> 01:57:08.250
"You're officially invited

01:57:08.333 --> 01:57:12.166
to the jammiest of jam sessions
on the sunniest of Sundays on the 30th."

01:57:16.458 --> 01:57:19.958
Music, food, games, love,
and most important of all, free entry.

01:57:20.041 --> 01:57:24.083
But remember,
kids must be accompanied by an adult.

01:57:24.708 --> 01:57:28.083
Four days left.
Then the construction starts in the park.

01:57:28.583 --> 01:57:31.291
These trees are the stories
of our past generations.

01:57:31.375 --> 01:57:33.166
If we forget our story, then who are we?

01:57:34.833 --> 01:57:38.416
This is our history.
We won't let it be erased.

01:57:39.458 --> 01:57:40.875
Be there if you care!

01:57:45.708 --> 01:57:46.916
Well done!

01:57:48.125 --> 01:57:49.458
Dilly, you genius.

01:57:49.541 --> 01:57:50.583
Thank you!

01:57:50.666 --> 01:57:52.416
Thank you!

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:06.583
Unlock the park gate now.

02:00:07.708 --> 02:00:10.875
I said unlock the park gate now!

02:00:11.666 --> 02:00:13.333
You are all minors.

02:00:13.416 --> 02:00:14.666
You don't want to go to jail.

02:00:16.041 --> 02:00:19.333
The police are here.
One word from the Council Head

02:00:19.416 --> 02:00:20.791
and you'll be…

02:00:20.875 --> 02:00:22.166
Mr. Dawson? Mr. Dawson!

02:00:27.375 --> 02:00:29.375
How did they know
we'd be here a day early?

02:00:29.458 --> 02:00:32.666
Good call, Miss Lodge,
making us spend the night here.

02:00:34.083 --> 02:00:36.500
Evacuate the premises!
This is the Council's order.

02:00:37.291 --> 02:00:38.708
Let the games begin.

02:00:39.875 --> 02:00:41.500
Save the Green!

02:00:41.583 --> 02:00:43.125
Save the Green!

02:00:46.375 --> 02:00:47.625
Save the Green!

02:00:47.708 --> 02:00:48.541
Shut up!

02:00:50.708 --> 02:00:52.291
This needs to stop.

02:00:52.375 --> 02:00:55.083
Keep quiet! Silence!

02:00:55.833 --> 02:00:57.041
Save the Green!

02:00:57.625 --> 02:00:58.750
Silence!

02:00:58.833 --> 02:00:59.958
Save the Green!

02:01:00.541 --> 02:01:01.833
I said keep quiet!

02:01:01.916 --> 02:01:04.500
Save the Green!

02:01:11.916 --> 02:01:13.916
Excuse me! Please!

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.416
Excuse me! Thank you.

02:01:18.583 --> 02:01:21.625
Save the Green! Save the Green!

02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:25.708
For crying out loud!

02:01:25.791 --> 02:01:27.875
You let her stay here all night?

02:01:27.958 --> 02:01:30.291
Have you ever tried stopping her, Hiram?

02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:33.083
She's your daughter, after all.

02:01:34.125 --> 02:01:36.583
Save the Green! Save the Green!

02:01:38.708 --> 02:01:40.416
Mrs. Lodge.

02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:41.458
Mr. Lodge.

02:01:42.125 --> 02:01:43.625
Sorry for these nuisance kids.

02:01:43.708 --> 02:01:45.583
I will order the police to force them out.

02:01:45.666 --> 02:01:47.291
You will do no such thing.

02:01:48.083 --> 02:01:50.708
But they will collect petitions,
Mrs. Lodge.

02:01:50.791 --> 02:01:52.916
What will happen if they hit the target?

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.416
Then I will lose the land,
and you will lose your donation.

02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:56.833
Precisely!

02:01:56.916 --> 02:01:58.375
Back off, Dawson.

02:01:58.916 --> 02:02:02.833
Nothing will happen,
they'll never get enough signatures.

02:02:02.916 --> 02:02:05.500
-Save the Green! Save the Green!
-Let them have their day.

02:02:07.625 --> 02:02:10.416
Save the Green! Save the Green!

02:02:24.250 --> 02:02:26.208
Eat anything in exchange for signatures!

02:02:26.291 --> 02:02:29.583
Four signatures a burger,
two signatures for fries.

02:02:29.666 --> 02:02:31.041
Signatures?

02:02:31.125 --> 02:02:33.166
-Can I get one of these?
-Two signatures for that.

02:02:35.833 --> 02:02:37.541
That's your third try!

02:02:38.375 --> 02:02:42.625
Wonderful! Okay. Who's next?
Three tries for three signatures.

02:02:42.708 --> 02:02:45.625
Come, light up the bulbs.
Let's see how strong you are.

02:02:45.708 --> 02:02:46.791
It's your lucky day.

02:02:46.875 --> 02:02:48.791
All this is from my personal stuff.

02:02:48.875 --> 02:02:52.625
Every item is marked.
That's five signatures, that's eight.

02:02:52.708 --> 02:02:54.625
-And that's ten.
-Ten?

02:02:54.708 --> 02:02:58.250
You want more style?
Get more signatures. Go, go!

02:02:58.333 --> 02:03:01.791
Who wants a makeover? Cut your hair.
Or style your hair.

02:03:01.875 --> 02:03:04.291
Spin the wheel and get a new look
for five signatures.

02:03:04.375 --> 02:03:05.708
-Ta, Pam.
-Anytime!

02:03:05.791 --> 02:03:08.625
-Looking good, Aunty Alice!
-Thank you, Ethel.

02:03:08.708 --> 02:03:12.125
Two signatures for a brownie
and three signatures for a slice of cake.

02:03:12.208 --> 02:03:14.583
-How's it going, my Betts?
-Good.

02:03:14.666 --> 02:03:15.791
Hello! What is this?

02:03:15.875 --> 02:03:18.625
This is comfort food
in your comfort place.

02:03:18.708 --> 02:03:20.166
Would you like some cake?

02:03:28.083 --> 02:03:29.625
Wow! So strong!

02:03:30.416 --> 02:03:33.041
Sign the petition. Ask a question.

02:03:33.125 --> 02:03:34.416
Get a punchline.

02:03:36.333 --> 02:03:38.083
Why are horses so strong?

02:03:39.250 --> 02:03:42.375
Because they live in a stable environment!

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:45.791
Knock-knock.

02:03:49.625 --> 02:03:50.625
Who's there?

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:52.791
Yam.

02:03:54.541 --> 02:03:55.416
Yam, who?

02:03:56.333 --> 02:03:57.791
Yeah, I'm very, very sorry.

02:04:03.541 --> 02:04:04.916
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.875
please give this corny joke some love.

02:04:11.375 --> 02:04:12.958
Mango orchard? Mary will take you.

02:04:13.041 --> 02:04:15.833
-This way to the mango orchard.
-The mango orchard, everyone.

02:04:15.916 --> 02:04:17.625
-Yeah. Mary is right there.
-Hello.

02:04:17.708 --> 02:04:20.000
We have to get
as many petitions as possible.

02:04:20.083 --> 02:04:21.666
I'm so proud of you guys…

02:04:23.541 --> 02:04:26.583
How many times do I have to tell you?
These books don't sell!

02:04:26.666 --> 02:04:27.625
Go, keep them inside.

02:04:45.708 --> 02:04:47.000
You're an hour late.

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:48.875
Sorry about that.

02:04:48.958 --> 02:04:50.958
We'll keep bringing you more
as they come in.

02:04:51.041 --> 02:04:52.125
You have till 5:00 p.m.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.583
Please count them carefully.

02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:58.166
Not a single signature will be missed.

02:04:58.250 --> 02:04:59.500
Thank you.

02:05:05.791 --> 02:05:06.708
Hello, everybody.

02:05:07.708 --> 02:05:10.000
Thank you so much for coming here today.

02:05:10.083 --> 02:05:12.208
You've seen The Archies perform before.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:16.083
Today we have some new band members.

02:05:17.166 --> 02:05:19.916
Friends who inspired the song
we're going to sing for you today.

02:05:20.625 --> 02:05:23.791
Let's meet them. We have Dilton Doiley.

02:05:25.333 --> 02:05:26.958
Reggie Mantle.

02:05:28.208 --> 02:05:29.583
Veronica Lodge.

02:05:30.208 --> 02:05:31.166
Betty Cooper.

02:05:32.833 --> 02:05:34.041
Ethel Muggs.

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:35.833
Moose Mason.

02:05:35.916 --> 02:05:37.166
And Midge Klump.

02:05:43.375 --> 02:05:47.458
My father once told me,
to make art one has to go in, not out.

02:05:48.208 --> 02:05:50.708
This song comes from our hearts.

02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:55.958
If you want to save this park like we do,

02:05:56.750 --> 02:05:59.125
then your signatures are needed.

02:05:59.791 --> 02:06:01.041
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:06:01.583 --> 02:06:03.416
I believe we can save this park.

02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:05.166
-Yes, we can!
-Go on!

02:06:05.250 --> 02:06:07.166
I believe we can save the Green.

02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:08.375
-Yes!
-Yes!

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.833
You come to me

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:33.541
I'll come to you

02:06:33.625 --> 02:06:38.166
Let us all come together

02:06:39.625 --> 02:06:42.541
You will sing

02:06:42.625 --> 02:06:45.083
I will sing too

02:06:45.166 --> 02:06:49.875
We will all sing together

02:06:52.541 --> 02:06:54.583
Here

02:06:55.458 --> 02:06:57.666
And there

02:06:58.625 --> 02:07:02.500
Everyone will hear us

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.958
Here

02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:08.875
And there

02:07:08.958 --> 02:07:15.250
Our voices will echo

02:07:15.333 --> 02:07:19.791
All our voices

02:07:20.708 --> 02:07:25.458
Will turn into sunbeams

02:07:27.291 --> 02:07:32.333
And those sunbeams

02:07:32.416 --> 02:07:36.666
Will brighten the world with new light

02:07:38.166 --> 02:07:41.041
My heart tells me

02:07:41.125 --> 02:07:47.916
If trouble or sadness casts over us

02:07:49.875 --> 02:07:52.583
They will be defeated

02:07:52.666 --> 02:07:55.708
We will win

02:07:55.791 --> 02:08:00.208
If we don't lose courage

02:08:02.791 --> 02:08:04.916
Here

02:08:05.708 --> 02:08:07.833
And there

02:08:08.875 --> 02:08:13.083
Everyone will hear us

02:08:14.125 --> 02:08:17.291
Here

02:08:17.375 --> 02:08:19.333
And there

02:08:19.416 --> 02:08:25.750
Our voices will echo

02:08:25.833 --> 02:08:30.750
All our voices

02:08:30.833 --> 02:08:36.083
Will turn into sunbeams

02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:41.791
And those sunbeams

02:08:42.916 --> 02:08:47.416
Will brighten the world with new light

02:09:43.291 --> 02:09:47.458
All our voices

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:53.083
Will turn into sunbeams

02:09:54.708 --> 02:09:59.791
And those sunbeams

02:09:59.875 --> 02:10:05.000
Will brighten the world with new light

02:10:06.666 --> 02:10:11.000
All our voices

02:10:11.875 --> 02:10:16.958
Will turn into sunbeams

02:10:18.458 --> 02:10:23.541
And those sunbeams

02:10:23.625 --> 02:10:28.416
Will brighten the world with new light

02:10:29.083 --> 02:10:32.708
If we all stand together

02:10:32.791 --> 02:10:35.541
Our heads will never bow

02:10:35.625 --> 02:10:38.750
You and I

02:10:38.833 --> 02:10:43.125
Will fulfill all our dreams

02:10:43.208 --> 02:10:47.416
No matter who tries to stop us

02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:48.958
Here

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.000
And there

02:10:50.083 --> 02:10:53.541
Our voices will echo

02:10:53.625 --> 02:10:57.916
All our voices

02:10:58.708 --> 02:11:03.166
Will turn into sunbeams

02:11:04.875 --> 02:11:09.708
And those sunbeams

02:11:10.416 --> 02:11:14.958
Will brighten the world with new light

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.333
All our voices

02:11:22.125 --> 02:11:26.250
Will turn into sunbeams

02:11:26.333 --> 02:11:29.000
Will turn into sunbeams

02:11:29.083 --> 02:11:33.458
And those sunbeams

02:11:33.541 --> 02:11:38.791
Will brighten the world with new light

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.333
Like I said,
some things are worth fighting for.

02:11:52.916 --> 02:11:56.750
We woke up to the last day of the year.
It was a cold morning.

02:11:57.458 --> 02:12:00.541
We were all waiting for
the voting results.

02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:04.916
Mr. Gomes went personally to the Gazette
with the final count.

02:12:10.916 --> 02:12:13.875
His next stop was at station master
Doiley's house.

02:12:13.958 --> 02:12:15.041
Dilly!

02:12:15.125 --> 02:12:17.666
Dilton's illegal radio
was going to be seized,

02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:21.041
but he was given permission
to make one final announcement.

02:12:21.125 --> 02:12:23.958
We've hit our target number of signatures!

02:12:24.041 --> 02:12:27.875
Dilly switched on the mic
and everyone turned up their radios.

02:12:27.958 --> 02:12:30.958
Dilton-vani could be heard in
every Riverdale home.

02:12:31.041 --> 02:12:34.625
The message was loud and clear,
just like the citizens of Riverdale.

02:12:34.708 --> 02:12:39.833
The town has been louder and clearer
than you could have ever imagined!

02:12:39.916 --> 02:12:43.458
Save the Green got 5,600 signatures!

02:12:43.541 --> 02:12:46.583
We won! No one could cut down our trees.

02:12:46.666 --> 02:12:48.416
Our history would remain untouched.

02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:50.500
The tradition of Planters Day
would live on.

02:12:50.583 --> 02:12:52.375
The permission for the hotel was revoked.

02:12:52.458 --> 02:12:56.583
Like they say,
you win some and you lose some.

02:12:56.666 --> 02:13:01.791
And guess what? Our class of '64
became Riverdale's most famous students.

02:13:01.875 --> 02:13:03.000
Moose!

02:13:04.583 --> 02:13:06.791
-What is "revoked"?
-I'll tell you later.

02:13:06.875 --> 02:13:08.625
Uncle Hal and Aunty Alice realized

02:13:08.708 --> 02:13:11.958
they should've done
what the kids managed to do.

02:13:12.041 --> 02:13:13.500
You cheeky kids.

02:13:13.583 --> 02:13:16.833
-They did what we couldn't.
-I didn't know how you did it!

02:13:16.916 --> 02:13:18.916
"Hoga!" Dad! You finally got it right.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.791
Fred's Hindi also improved miraculously.

02:13:21.875 --> 02:13:25.541
And like every successful man,
Mr. Lodge rolled with the punches.

02:13:25.625 --> 02:13:29.416
He saw himself in his daughter
and that was his victory.

02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:32.750
You showed us that no one
is too young to change the world.

02:13:33.583 --> 02:13:34.666
Well played, kiddo!

02:13:35.958 --> 02:13:37.125
Thank you.

02:13:37.208 --> 02:13:38.041
We did it!

02:13:38.125 --> 02:13:40.458
Pop Tates announced free meals
for everyone that day.

02:13:41.166 --> 02:13:43.208
Come, I'll tell you what "revoke" is.

02:13:44.041 --> 02:13:47.208
Yet Mr. Dawson could not finish
his breakfast.

02:13:47.291 --> 02:13:50.375
Except for him, the whole town
came out to celebrate.

02:13:50.458 --> 02:13:53.333
This was going to be
a very happy new year,

02:13:54.208 --> 02:13:56.625
because The Archies had done it!

02:14:03.583 --> 02:14:05.875
Baby!

02:14:09.916 --> 02:14:11.750
Baby!

02:14:13.375 --> 02:14:16.291
A new color paints every passing moment

02:14:16.375 --> 02:14:19.041
Life has this new zing

02:14:19.125 --> 02:14:20.750
Come with me

02:14:21.708 --> 02:14:23.833
Let's take this road together

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.958
A new color paints every passing moment

02:14:29.041 --> 02:14:31.791
Life has this new zing

02:14:31.875 --> 02:14:33.833
Come with me

02:14:34.583 --> 02:14:36.583
Let's take this road together

02:14:38.875 --> 02:14:44.333
The road up ahead has no end

02:14:45.416 --> 02:14:50.875
Spring is here, light on its feet

02:14:50.958 --> 02:14:54.833
Spreading a song in the air

02:14:58.041 --> 02:14:59.583
Baby!

02:15:01.166 --> 02:15:04.250
New hopes, new dreams

02:15:04.333 --> 02:15:06.750
The sky and the earth belong to us

02:15:06.833 --> 02:15:08.583
Come with me

02:15:09.791 --> 02:15:11.625
Let's take this road together

02:15:13.916 --> 02:15:16.500
A new season has come to stay

02:15:17.166 --> 02:15:19.791
Nowhere is too far to go

02:15:19.875 --> 02:15:22.416
Come with me

02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:24.208
Let's take this road together

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.583
All the roads ahead

02:15:29.666 --> 02:15:32.541
Unwind for us

02:15:33.416 --> 02:15:39.166
Spring is here, light on its feet

02:15:39.250 --> 02:15:42.916
Spreading a song in the air

02:15:45.791 --> 02:15:49.250
Baby! Baby!

02:15:52.375 --> 02:15:54.958
Baby!

02:15:58.666 --> 02:16:01.833
Baby! Baby!

02:16:05.208 --> 02:16:07.750
Baby!

02:16:15.750 --> 02:16:21.625
The voice in my heart says
We must be together

02:16:21.708 --> 02:16:25.291
Say it out loud, let everyone hear

02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:33.125
The road that stretches out ahead

02:16:34.083 --> 02:16:40.000
Sways and dances in every season

02:16:40.083 --> 02:16:43.458
Sings its song to you

02:16:43.541 --> 02:16:49.416
The road that stretches out ahead

02:16:50.125 --> 02:16:56.000
Sways and dances in every season

02:16:56.083 --> 02:16:59.708
Sings its song to you

02:17:02.708 --> 02:17:05.875
Baby! Baby!

02:17:09.291 --> 02:17:12.458
Baby! Baby!

02:17:41.375 --> 02:17:46.041
Can't help it now, can I?
I'm the king of wishful thinking

02:17:46.125 --> 02:17:50.875
The world may say what it wants to say
I'm way past caring

02:17:50.958 --> 02:17:55.666
I dance to my own tune
Lost to this world am I

02:17:55.750 --> 02:18:00.291
A vast kingdom within my mind
I dwell in fantasy

02:18:00.375 --> 02:18:05.875
Stop me if you think you can
I'm off to touch the sky

02:18:19.791 --> 02:18:24.625
I choose my path, my journey
I'm my own company

02:18:24.708 --> 02:18:29.291
With my desire I chart the course
Of my own destiny

02:18:29.375 --> 02:18:34.000
You'll have to admit
There's no one quite like me

02:18:34.083 --> 02:18:38.750
Any challenge thrown my way
Is dispatched quite deftly

02:18:38.833 --> 02:18:44.541
Stop me if you think you can
I'm off to touch the sky

02:18:47.791 --> 02:18:53.291
My dreams are beyond
Your reckoning or control

02:18:53.375 --> 02:18:57.916
My heart thunders like a train
My wheels are on a roll

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.541
Stop me if you think you can
I'm off to touch the sky

02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:32.333
Stop me if you think you can
I'm off to touch the sky

02:19:36.875 --> 02:19:41.583
Touch, touch the sky, yeah
Touch, touch the sky, yeah

02:19:41.666 --> 02:19:46.375
Touch, touch the sky, yeah
Touch, touch the sky, yeah

02:19:46.458 --> 02:19:51.250
Touch, touch the sky, yeah
Touch, touch the sky, yeah

02:19:51.333 --> 02:19:56.708
Touch, touch the sky, yeah
Touch, touch the sky, yeah

02:20:08.916 --> 02:20:12.833
My heart beats boom-boom for you

02:20:13.875 --> 02:20:18.000
You make me feel like Sunday on a Saturday

02:20:19.041 --> 02:20:24.041
My heart bells ring ding-dong for you

02:20:24.125 --> 02:20:28.291
You make me smile like I am on a holiday

02:20:29.291 --> 02:20:33.583
My blue guitar goes ting-ting
For you, my love

02:20:34.541 --> 02:20:38.500
I may not be Sinatra, I'll sing it anyway

02:20:39.625 --> 02:20:43.833
O Ruby, if life were plum pudding

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.583
You'd be the sugar and spice

02:20:49.666 --> 02:20:53.958
O Michael, if life were plum pudding

02:20:55.250 --> 02:20:59.500
You'd be the sweetest surprise

02:21:10.458 --> 02:21:14.416
O Ruby, if life were plum pudding

02:21:15.708 --> 02:21:20.375
You'd be the sugar and spice

02:21:20.458 --> 02:21:24.833
O Michael, you are my plum pudding

02:21:26.041 --> 02:21:30.291
Sweeter than sugar, my love

02:21:31.083 --> 02:21:35.500
Sweeter than sugar, my love

02:21:36.166 --> 02:21:40.291
Sweeter than sugar, my love

02:21:41.291 --> 02:21:44.958
Sweeter than sugar

02:21:45.041 --> 02:21:49.625
My love
