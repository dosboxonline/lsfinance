12:33.294 --> 12:34.587
I heard there'll be one.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.797
MOM: WHICH ONE DO YOU LIKE?
CHEONG-SAN: CAN YOU NOT USE MY NAME?

12:36.881 --> 12:38.924
I mean, I would know better than you,
don't you think?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.342
MOM: OKAY. SO WHICH ONE?
CHEONG-SAN: MOM…

12:40.426 --> 12:42.052
[grumbles]
My mom's the worst.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.596
[grunts]

12:43.679 --> 12:45.598
-[I-sak] Hey.
-Damn, my phone!

12:45.681 --> 12:46.932
You can't run away.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.144
Hey, gopher. Let's get some chicken.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.437
But we're not open yet.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.521
Sure you are.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.482
Your mom says she's testing out
a new recipe today.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.399
[grunts]

12:55.483 --> 12:56.484
You're going, right?

12:56.567 --> 12:57.693
Of course.
[chuckles]

12:59.111 --> 13:01.405
-Are you going too?
-Mm. Yes.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.907
I mean your mom told On-jo
to bring her friends.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.700
Uh, so, is this a double date?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.452
What the hell?

13:07.328 --> 13:09.413
-Weird, we're not open today.
-Cool.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.582
Uh, what do you know?
Let's get out of here.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.419
[whistling to the tune of Auld Lang Syne]

13:15.503 --> 13:16.921
[both chuckle]

13:17.004 --> 13:18.631
-[Cheong-san] You like chicken that much?
-[Gyeong-su] Oh, you bet.

13:18.714 --> 13:19.757
I'm gonna eat two whole ones.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.510

13:22.593 --> 13:24.303
-[cheering, applauding]

13:25.346 --> 13:26.347
Looks great. Thank you.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.473
-Thanks a lot.
-[I-sak] It looks so good.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.599
-Why'd you bring out so much?
-Oh, yes.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.392
Remember On-jo eats a lot.
[laughs]

13:30.476 --> 13:31.769
I don't eat a lot.

13:31.852 --> 13:32.686
I just eat well.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.980
Oh, yes, sure. That's what I like to hear.

13:35.064 --> 13:35.898
Eat up, Gyeong-su.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.900
-Yep.
-You too, A-sak.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.945
It's I-sak, not A-sak.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.112
You change your name?

13:42.196 --> 13:43.405
[laughs awkwardly]

13:43.489 --> 13:44.573
[girls laughing]

13:44.657 --> 13:47.952
Mom. If you wanna change names,
you should start with the restaurant.

13:48.035 --> 13:48.994
Why are you using my name?

13:49.078 --> 13:51.789
I named it Cheongsan Chicken
way before you were born.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.792
Exactly. You named me
after the restaurant.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.210
-Hey. Ah…
-I don't like--

13:56.293 --> 13:57.503
Quiet. Okay.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.879
I really like it. Sounds like a tradition.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.381
-Yeah?
-Of course.

14:00.464 --> 14:01.924
[both] He's right.

14:02.633 --> 14:06.011
Look, so this is a new recipe
we just came up with.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.515
So this one is just a little spicy,
and this one's really hot.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.350
[Cheong-san's mom] What do you think?

14:11.433 --> 14:13.143
[stammers]
You can be totally honest with me.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.311
[chuckles]

14:14.937 --> 14:16.689
[mumbles]
It's super crazy mad good.

14:17.898 --> 14:18.857
It's delicious.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.610
-[Cheong-san's mom] Really?
-Oh, ma'am, look.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.572
If you ever need a delivery boy,
I'll work for cheap.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.490
[laughs]
You guys need to study.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.285
On-jo. Is it too hot?

14:30.828 --> 14:31.745
It's salty.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.122
Yeah?

14:33.205 --> 14:34.039
Oh…

14:34.874 --> 14:36.834
How about this one? Is it spicy?

14:37.334 --> 14:38.711
No. It's salty.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.130
Wait a sec. That's not…

14:41.213 --> 14:42.298
Uhm, honey!

14:42.381 --> 14:44.258
-[Cheong-san's dad] Yeah?
-She says it's salty.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.051
It's salty?

14:46.135 --> 14:48.095
-On-jo says it's salty.
-Wait, I…

14:48.178 --> 14:49.513
-It can't be.
-It's good.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.640
-[Cheong-san's mom] Maybe you left…
-I don't think it's salty at all.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.392
-Yeah, it's good.
-It tastes good to me.

14:53.475 --> 14:54.768
[Cheong-san's dad] Let me see.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.520
Stop eating. It's salty.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.064
It still tastes good.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.649
[indistinct chattering in distance]

15:02.651 --> 15:03.485
Ah.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.156
Did you hear our science teacher?

15:08.115 --> 15:09.450
What about him?

15:09.533 --> 15:11.035
Well, he smells like a rotting corpse.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.746
Oh, Na-yeon spread that rumor, right?

15:13.829 --> 15:14.955
It's true.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.207
He was absent after his son went missing.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.542
But then he came into class…

15:18.626 --> 15:21.086
-[class clamoring]

15:23.339 --> 15:24.632
[eerie music]

15:25.633 --> 15:27.176
[On-jo] …she said
he smelled like a corpse.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.261
[Cheong-san] How does she know
what a corpse smells like?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.638
Has she smelled one before?

15:31.555 --> 15:34.600
I swear she knows every other smell
except that one.

15:34.683 --> 15:37.728
Since she never smelled it before,
it has to be a rotting corpse.

15:37.811 --> 15:40.230
[On-jo] When his son went missing,
he started acting weird.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.398
He was an outcast.
[munching]

15:42.691 --> 15:44.193
I heard he got bullied all the time.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.612
Mm-hm. It sucks.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.572
I feel really bad for Mr. Lee.

They say he was a genius.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.539

16:54.054 --> 16:56.306
Why? We're late.
And I have a music test.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.142
I just need to ask you something.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.810
What is it?

-Nothing.
-What?

Nothing. Don't worry about it.

[breathes shakily]
That's not it.

23:35.956 --> 23:39.000
Then why the hell did you decide
to tattle on me, you little prick?

23:39.084 --> 23:41.753
The teacher said
to write down everything we knew.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.130
And what do you know, huh?

Who's in touch with Hyeon-ju?

29:18.173 --> 29:19.466
Nobody?

29:19.549 --> 29:20.925
So none of you have tried
calling her today?

[clears throat]
Uh, we cleaned the science lab

29:23.970 --> 29:27.140
together yesterday,
but I haven't seen her since.

-[Wu-jin] You idiot.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.379
How stupid is he?

30:00.131 --> 30:01.758
Why is it so much fun to mess with him?

30:01.841 --> 30:02.759
Huh?

30:08.765 --> 30:10.266
[Dae-su whispers]
What you gonna do about it?

30:10.350 --> 30:11.434

This is your phone from last year.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.702
Uh, you know Kim Hyeon-ju from my class?

30:29.786 --> 30:31.246
She didn't make it home last night.

30:31.329 --> 30:32.205
And…

30:32.789 --> 30:33.957
The kids haven't seen her

30:34.040 --> 30:35.792
since she was cleaning
the science lab yesterday.

No, I haven't.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.428
Uh, so yesterday you went home

30:47.512 --> 30:49.222
without stopping by
the science lab, right?

30:49.973 --> 30:51.140
That's what I told you.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.476
I…
[frustrated laugh]

30:53.560 --> 30:54.853
…I'm sorry.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.599
[Mr. Lee] A virus…

32:57.809 --> 33:03.648
is somewhere between a living organism
and a non-living organism.

33:03.731 --> 33:07.610
Like a living organism,
it adapts to its surroundings and evolves.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.825
Everything that evolves in this manner

33:15.243 --> 33:17.996
should be considered
an independent living organism.

33:18.079 --> 33:22.417
Mr. Lee, the textbook says a virus is not
an independent living organism.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.420
Whether or not it's categorized that way

33:25.503 --> 33:28.381
doesn't depend on its metabolism,
but its will to survive.

33:28.464 --> 33:30.258
[students laughing]

33:30.341 --> 33:31.300
[shuddering]

33:31.384 --> 33:32.844
If its will is so strong…

33:33.386 --> 33:34.512
[students laughing]

33:35.138 --> 33:37.682
I'M SO SEXY

33:38.266 --> 33:39.851
-[laughing continues]
-[shudders]

33:41.519 --> 33:44.814
The instinct to survive
actually surpasses intelligence.

33:44.897 --> 33:45.732
[whimpers]

33:45.815 --> 33:49.235
[Mr. Lee] And eventually the ecosystem
is dominated by that will.

33:49.318 --> 33:52.613
Humanity has never once
completely defeated a virus.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.327
Leucochloridium paradoxum.

33:58.411 --> 33:59.245
[sobbing]

33:59.328 --> 34:02.498
This parasite's
final destination is a bird.

34:05.168 --> 34:08.629
The parasite enters a snail
and infects its ocular tentacles.

34:08.713 --> 34:12.341
That makes the snail put itself
in the path of predatory birds.

34:13.092 --> 34:16.721
So the infected snail commits suicide
at the whim of the parasite.

34:17.680 --> 34:18.848
[suspenseful music]

34:18.931 --> 34:20.516
-Tell me.
-[shudders]

34:21.017 --> 34:24.937
Now, is that because the snail
is less intelligent?

34:28.900 --> 34:29.901
It's not.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.738
It's because
the parasite's will to survive

34:33.821 --> 34:35.448
is much stronger than the snail's.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.659
-Shut up when the teacher's talking.
-[Mr. Lee] The evolving…

34:38.743 --> 34:40.870
…and hereditary will to survive is…

34:40.953 --> 34:41.913
Keep your head up.

34:43.289 --> 34:46.459
…the sole standard by which
living organisms are defined.

34:46.542 --> 34:47.543
[ominous music]

34:47.627 --> 34:49.337
So is the textbook wrong?

34:53.508 --> 34:54.675
The textbook?

34:59.055 --> 35:00.348
It's wrong.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.975
[snarls]

35:04.018 --> 35:06.020
[ominous music continues]

35:09.774 --> 35:10.775
[growls]

35:11.567 --> 35:12.527
-[snaps]
-[grunts]

35:13.736 --> 35:14.737
[bone cracks]

35:17.990 --> 35:21.661
[Sun-hwa] In fact, none of us
are completely free from prejudice.

35:21.744 --> 35:24.622
We all have
preconceived ideas about others.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.334
Here, "free from" means
the lacking in or unincumbered by.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.212
Anyone want to interpret this?

35:31.295 --> 35:33.214
[tapping on board]

35:34.132 --> 35:35.299
Okay.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.634
Hee-su.

35:36.717 --> 35:39.512
I need to use the bathroom.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.972
Okay, go.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.390
[students murmuring]

35:43.891 --> 35:45.434
Okay, then.
[Sun-hwa sighs]

35:45.518 --> 35:47.687
Anyone wanna have a crack at it, huh?

35:47.770 --> 35:49.230
[tapping on board]

35:49.313 --> 35:50.523
Class president?

35:52.567 --> 35:56.154
The truth is, all of us have
some sort of prejudice.

35:56.237 --> 35:59.532
[Nam-ra] We all have preconceptions
about other people.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.576
Hmm, okay. Nice.

36:01.659 --> 36:04.245
[inhales]
Next, Bare-su. Stand up.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.621
[students laugh]

36:05.705 --> 36:06.622
Stand up.

36:07.206 --> 36:08.040
[Su-hyeok] Yes?

36:08.124 --> 36:09.458
What's with "Bare-su"?

36:09.542 --> 36:10.918
Mm…

36:11.002 --> 36:13.421
It's short for Barefoot Su-hyeok. Bare-su.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.755
-[girls laugh]
-Ah.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.425
He hates wearing socks.
He's so weird about it.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.136
I can smell it a mile away.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.013
[class laughing]

36:22.597 --> 36:23.973
Okay, Bare-su.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.766
What did Nam-ra say a minute ago?

36:26.350 --> 36:27.393
[shushes]

36:27.894 --> 36:28.769
Ah…

36:28.853 --> 36:31.189
[class] Ah…

36:31.272 --> 36:33.774
-[girls giggling]
-[class murmuring]

36:33.858 --> 36:35.651
She was absolutely correct.
A hundred percent.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.236
[class laughing]

36:37.320 --> 36:40.114
What was her absolutely correct
answer then?

36:40.198 --> 36:41.949
[exhales]
Hmm…

36:42.033 --> 36:43.910
-[murmurs]
-[chuckles]

36:43.993 --> 36:44.911
All right…

36:44.994 --> 36:46.329
[exhales]

36:46.412 --> 36:47.747
-[Su-hyeok] Huh?
-[door slides opened]

36:48.497 --> 36:49.665
[suspenseful music]

36:50.291 --> 36:51.250
[Sun-hwa] Hyeon-ju.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.461
-Hey, Hyeon-ju.
-[class clamoring]

36:53.544 --> 36:54.921
[gasps]
Hyeon-ju!

36:55.004 --> 36:57.006
Hey. What's wrong? Are you okay?

36:57.089 --> 36:59.592
-Hey, Hyeon-ju.
-[Na-yeon] Is that blood?

36:59.675 --> 37:00.843
Ms. Park.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.387
Yeah, it's me. Do you recognize me?

37:03.471 --> 37:04.972
He grabbed me…

37:05.056 --> 37:06.182
[breathes shakily]

37:06.265 --> 37:09.060
The science teacher grabbed me
and locked me up.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.519
-[Sun-hwa] He locked you up?
-[students murmuring]

37:10.603 --> 37:11.729
The science teacher?

37:11.812 --> 37:13.689
-Mr. Lee Byeong-chan, huh?
-[gasps]

37:13.773 --> 37:15.441
He tied me up…

37:15.524 --> 37:17.109
-[Na-yeon] I told you, didn't I?
-[breathing heavily]

37:17.193 --> 37:18.444
[Hyo-ryeong] Just shut up, okay?

37:18.527 --> 37:20.112
Let's go to the infirmary, okay?

37:20.196 --> 37:21.948
-What kind of a psycho does this?
-Nam-ra.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.324
[Sun-hwa] Make sure
they study on their own.

37:23.407 --> 37:26.410
And please don't say anything to anyone
until I come back and confirm the facts.

37:26.911 --> 37:29.121
Hyeon-ju. Can you get up?

37:29.205 --> 37:30.039
I'll carry her.

37:30.122 --> 37:31.457
[Sun-hwa] Okay.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.584
-Can someone help him out, please.
-Here.

37:33.668 --> 37:34.669
-[Sun-hwa] Good.
-Okay.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.380
-[Sun-hwa] Go back to your seats!
-[Su-hyeok grunts]

37:37.463 --> 37:38.464
Now.

37:38.547 --> 37:41.133
[tense suspenseful music]

37:41.217 --> 37:44.470
[all panting]

37:46.597 --> 37:48.182
-Hyeon-ju.
-[I-sak] What's wrong?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.517
[Sun-hwa] Guys, hold her still.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.021
-[rapid footsteps]
-What's wrong with her?

37:54.105 --> 37:55.856
[all panting]

37:57.900 --> 37:59.485
[groans, breathing heavily]

37:59.568 --> 38:01.320
What's wrong? Do you feel sick?

38:01.904 --> 38:03.739
What do I do?
[whimpering]

38:03.823 --> 38:05.449
[nurse] Does your stomach hurt? Is it bad?

38:05.533 --> 38:06.492
Let me see.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.035
Please help.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.870
-Huh?
-[nurse] Uh, wait, hold on.

38:09.954 --> 38:10.871
Put her on the bed.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.623
-Please take a look at her.
-Here, lookout.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.252
[beeps]

38:17.878 --> 38:19.797
Her temperature is way too low.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.966
Here, hold it down
so she doesn't kick it off.

38:22.049 --> 38:23.092
[growls]

38:23.175 --> 38:24.510
[Su-hyeok] Hold her. Hold her.

38:24.593 --> 38:26.220
-Hyeon-ju, Hyeon-ju. It's okay.
-Call an ambulance right now.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.847
I'll give her a sedative
and clean her wounds.

38:27.930 --> 38:28.764
[Sun-hwa] Okay.

38:29.473 --> 38:30.474
[Hyeon-ju grunting]

38:30.558 --> 38:31.726
[Sun-hwa] Hyeon-ju. It's okay.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.645
Hyeon-ju. You're okay now.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.274
[tense suspenseful music continues]

38:40.776 --> 38:41.777
[keypad beeps]

38:42.903 --> 38:43.821
EMERGENCY CALL

38:44.405 --> 38:46.782
-[phone line ringing]
-[Hyeon-ju snarls]

38:49.493 --> 38:51.620
[groans, sighs]

38:54.290 --> 38:55.458
[breathes heavily]

38:58.085 --> 39:00.296
[grunting softly]

39:01.172 --> 39:03.716
-[Hyeon-ju] Too hot.
-Hang in there, Hyeon-ju.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.051
Your temperature is a little too low.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.719
Too hot. I'm too hot.

39:06.802 --> 39:07.970
You're going to the hospital soon.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.764
We're all here for you,
so don't worry, okay?

39:09.847 --> 39:12.558
The science teacher gave me a weird shot.

39:13.476 --> 39:14.393
A shot?

39:14.477 --> 39:16.854
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan gave you a weird shot?

39:17.897 --> 39:19.482
He tried to kill me.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.650
[breathes shakily]

39:21.734 --> 39:23.527
-Hey, Hyeon-ju, tell me what shot?
-[Hyeon-ju gasps]

39:23.611 --> 39:25.613
I'm gonna kill them all.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.239
-[shrieks]
-Hyeon-ju.

39:28.574 --> 39:29.867
-[snarls]
-[gasps]

39:30.618 --> 39:32.119
[Sun-hwa] Hey, are you okay?

39:32.203 --> 39:34.538
-Hold her down so I can give her the shot.
-Okay.

39:36.749 --> 39:37.792
Just a minute, okay?

39:38.376 --> 39:40.127
Hyeon-ju. Just hang on.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.176
[Hyo-ryeong] It's so strange.
Hyeon-ju was really odd.

39:47.259 --> 39:48.177
-[Na-yeon] Yeah, totally.
-[Hyo-ryeong] It's weird.

39:48.260 --> 39:51.430
Everyone else saw that, right?
First, she just disappeared all day,

39:51.514 --> 39:54.266
then she comes in all bloody
talking about the science teacher.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.435
She could have gone somewhere
and got hurt,

39:56.519 --> 39:57.895
then came back here
and collapsed all of a sudden.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.815
-It's got to be true.
-Did you hear something?

40:01.941 --> 40:05.152
You know how we heard
his son went missing?

40:05.986 --> 40:08.531
I heard he didn't go missing.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.033
-Suicide.
-Come on, don't fall for that.

40:11.117 --> 40:11.951
-That's silly.
-He committed suicide?

40:12.034 --> 40:14.787
-You believe that?
-No, really. It's true, okay?

40:15.413 --> 40:18.582
Hyeon-ju hung out with the same crowd
that bullied Jin-su all the time.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.752
So the science teacher
went after them one-by-one.

40:21.836 --> 40:22.878
He hunted them down.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.756
-And kill them.
-Who said that?

40:25.840 --> 40:28.008
-All his students.
-[Ji-min] Which one?

40:28.092 --> 40:31.095
Last time I saw Hyeon-ju
was in the science lab.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.221
[breathes sharply]
Hey.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.682
I think maybe…

40:34.765 --> 40:37.101
Mr. Lee made porn with Hyeon-ju.

40:37.184 --> 40:38.978
-[Gyeong-su] Porn?
-Hey, you moron.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.771
Get your mind out of the gutter, asshole.

40:40.855 --> 40:41.856
[Wu-jin] You fat ass.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.524
[Dae-su] Why are you cursing at me, dick?

40:43.607 --> 40:45.025
[Wu-jin] Because you're a fucking pervert,
dumb ass.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.527
[Dae-su] So why did he kidnap her then?

40:46.610 --> 40:48.779
-Have you ever been kidnapped?
-Of course not. Stupid.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.322
-Easy, I'm your brother-in-law.
-[scoffs]

40:50.406 --> 40:52.074
-I told you to stop saying that.
-[grunts]

40:54.118 --> 40:55.661
-[class clamoring]
-[student] Hey, tell us what happened?

40:56.412 --> 40:58.164
I-sak, wait, what happened?

40:58.998 --> 41:00.416
-[Gyeong-su] Hey, what happened?
-[Wu-jin] How is she?

41:00.499 --> 41:01.584
[Hyo-ryeong] How's Hyeon-ju?

41:02.084 --> 41:04.253
It's no joke.
She was biting people and trashing around…

41:04.336 --> 41:05.171
Where's On-jo?

41:05.254 --> 41:06.130
She got hurt.

41:06.213 --> 41:08.299
Where? How bad?

41:08.382 --> 41:09.508
She'll be fine.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.093
Uh, Hyeon-ju bit her?

41:11.177 --> 41:12.470
I think she went crazy.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.972
[I-sak] Her temperature is super low,
but she said she was hot.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.557
She tried to bite us.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.225
-[Na-yeon] What the hell?
-So does she have rabies?

41:18.309 --> 41:19.602
[Dae-su sighs]
What an idiot.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.896
And Hyeon-ju had this weird smell.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.023
-[Na-yeon] What smell?
-The same one as the science teacher.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.524
-A rotting corpse.
-Yeah, that.

41:25.608 --> 41:26.859
-I knew it.
-And she said,

41:26.942 --> 41:28.736
Mr. Lee gave her some kind of weird shot.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.404
What a total psycho.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.823
-[class clamoring]
-Shouldn't we tell the police about this?

41:32.907 --> 41:35.493
I don't know.
Ms. Park said she's gonna handle it.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.204
Look…

41:38.287 --> 41:40.498
She's just been sitting there studying.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.416
Yeah, well, she is the top student.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.544
-So? Where's On-jo?
-[I-sak] In the infirmary.

41:46.795 --> 41:48.797
[suspenseful music]

42:00.309 --> 42:01.519
[grunts]

42:01.602 --> 42:03.729
It seems like she went
into shock due to hypothermia.

42:03.812 --> 42:04.980
I manage to give her a sedative.

42:05.564 --> 42:08.192
Okay. We'll take her to Hyosan Hospital.
Did you contact her parents?

42:08.275 --> 42:11.487
Yeah. I did. They're on their way.
Please take good care of her.

42:11.570 --> 42:12.821
-Will do.
-[nurse] Thank you.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.199
AMBULANCE

42:15.282 --> 42:16.200
Thank you.

42:16.283 --> 42:17.785
-[On-jo's father] Are you okay?
-[nurse] That was scary.

42:17.868 --> 42:19.620
Look at me. Were you scared?

42:19.703 --> 42:20.871
Definitely.

42:21.497 --> 42:22.790
[sighs]
Man.

42:23.666 --> 42:26.085
So, what's wrong with her?

42:26.168 --> 42:28.796
I don't know.
I'll tell you later when I get home.

42:29.421 --> 42:32.132
I'm on calls, so I won't be home.

42:33.008 --> 42:34.552
Just try not to get it wet.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.428
Call me right away
if you need anything at all.

42:36.512 --> 42:38.180
I'll rush right over. Okay?

42:38.264 --> 42:40.307
-Okay.
-Good. Bye, hon.

42:42.101 --> 42:43.852
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

42:43.936 --> 42:47.398
Thank you and take good care
of her for me please.

42:47.481 --> 42:48.482
Given the situation,

42:48.566 --> 42:50.109
-I can't stick around.
-[Sun-hwa] Okay.

42:50.192 --> 42:51.235
-Hurry up, Dad.
-[Sun-hwa] You should go.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.320
[engine revving]

43:03.372 --> 43:04.790
Thank you for your help, guys.

43:05.374 --> 43:07.376
I'm going to head back in a few minutes…

43:09.128 --> 43:12.214
Please make sure you don't tell anyone
about this just yet, okay?

43:12.298 --> 43:13.340
-Yeah.
-Mm-hm.

43:13.424 --> 43:14.258
[Sun-hwa] All right.

43:15.175 --> 43:17.136
I think it's better not to tell anyone
for the time being.

43:17.219 --> 43:18.178
Sounds good.

43:19.972 --> 43:21.890
[Sun-hwa] Go back to class. Let's go.

43:23.225 --> 43:25.311
Are you okay? Does she bite you?

43:26.478 --> 43:29.481
-No, it's just a scratch.
-You sure you're all good?

43:32.735 --> 43:35.821
Hey. You wanted to meet on the roof?

43:35.904 --> 43:38.449
-What?
-You said come up after lunch.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.286
Can you just tell me now?

43:42.870 --> 43:44.371
I'm actually
playing basketball after lunch.

43:46.206 --> 43:48.417
[cheeky music]

43:54.673 --> 43:55.549
What's that?

44:00.095 --> 44:01.764
NAM ON-JO

44:01.847 --> 44:03.474
[stammers]
Wait. This means…

44:04.558 --> 44:05.726
you wanna go out with me.

44:07.394 --> 44:08.646
Yeah.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.189
But aren't you with Cheong-san?

44:10.272 --> 44:11.523
No.

44:12.024 --> 44:14.360
We've lived next door
ever since we were little kids,

44:14.443 --> 44:16.111
and his mom always gives me free chicken…

44:16.195 --> 44:17.613
[inhales]
…and I do like chicken.

44:17.696 --> 44:18.906
I love it actually.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.115
-[flustered exhale]
-But not him, I swear.

44:20.949 --> 44:22.034
Ah, okay.

44:22.701 --> 44:23.744
-[Cheong-san] On-jo!
-So I--

44:25.245 --> 44:26.372
Where did you get hurt?

44:27.873 --> 44:29.333
How bad is it, huh?

44:29.416 --> 44:30.709
You're such a klutz sometimes.

44:30.793 --> 44:32.002
[On-jo scoffs]
I'm fine.

44:34.922 --> 44:37.675
How bad was she hurt?
She's pretty clumsy, huh?

44:37.758 --> 44:38.759
[clicks tongue]
No.

44:39.426 --> 44:40.928
Hyeon-ju tried to bite us.

44:41.011 --> 44:42.763
She got hurt
trying to stay out of the way.

44:42.846 --> 44:43.806
Hey.

44:44.556 --> 44:45.933
You're going out with On-jo?

44:48.560 --> 44:49.561
Right?

44:49.645 --> 44:52.022
Mm-hm. Right.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.816
[sighs, clicks tongue]

44:53.899 --> 44:56.026
Can't believe you bought that? You freak.

44:57.027 --> 44:58.946
Seriously, even if it was
the end of the world,

44:59.029 --> 45:00.614
and it was her, me, and a zombie,

45:00.697 --> 45:02.491
I'd honestly rather date the zombie.

45:03.575 --> 45:04.451
Why do you ask?

45:04.535 --> 45:05.786
[Su-hyeok] No reason.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.830
[chuckles awkwardly]
Let's go.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.581
[Su-hyeok] Anyway, what's for lunch today?

45:10.124 --> 45:11.083
Do you have any idea?

45:11.166 --> 45:12.751
[Cheong-san] I want some tonkatsu.

45:12.835 --> 45:14.378

45:42.364 --> 45:43.532
She went to the hospital.

45:44.408 --> 45:45.409
[sighs]

45:45.492 --> 45:46.577
-Wait.
-Mr. Lee. Wait.

45:46.660 --> 45:48.579
You don't understand.
She can't be in a hospital.

45:48.662 --> 45:49.580
-Let all calm down.
-What are you talking about?

45:49.663 --> 45:51.081
No! Let go of me!

45:51.165 --> 45:53.292
No! It's time for you
to explain yourself here.

45:53.375 --> 45:54.793
We can't send Hyeon-ju to a hospital.

45:54.877 --> 45:56.503
We have to put her in quarantine.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.713
[yelling] Hey.

45:57.796 --> 45:58.964
Sit down, Mr. Lee.

45:59.047 --> 46:00.340
You've already turned things upside down

46:00.424 --> 46:02.384
when you're at school
with the story about your son.

46:02.468 --> 46:05.637
How the hell could you say that?
Jin-su was the victim!

46:05.721 --> 46:07.431
And of course, you forced us to bury it.

46:08.307 --> 46:10.476
Oh, that's some crack of bullshit, huh?

46:10.559 --> 46:12.978
You know how the school's evaluation
is just around the corner.

46:13.562 --> 46:16.273
You should've called me
before calling an ambulance, Sun-hwa.

46:16.356 --> 46:17.983
What do you think
is gonna happen if the police come?

46:18.066 --> 46:19.610
Well, I already called the police.

46:19.693 --> 46:21.737
A teacher should deal
with school matters internally.

46:21.820 --> 46:23.447
[principal] I'll call the police
if we need them.

46:23.530 --> 46:24.448
-Tell them not to come.
-[Sun-hwa] I mean…

46:24.531 --> 46:25.657
-[Jae-ik] Mr. Lee.
-[grunts]

-Nothing.

Hey, Cheong-san can feel that.

48:18.270 --> 48:19.271
I wasn't looking at him.

48:19.771 --> 48:20.856
Yeah, right.

48:20.939 --> 48:22.608
The whole school knows
you two are going out on dates.

48:22.691 --> 48:23.650
We're not dating.

48:25.861 --> 48:26.945
I'm serious.

48:27.029 --> 48:28.905
Mm-hm, sure. Yeah.

48:30.532 --> 48:31.617
Actually…

48:32.868 --> 48:34.244
You can't tell anyone, okay?

48:34.828 --> 48:35.912
About what?

48:37.039 --> 48:38.040
Well…

-[laughs]

-Stop it.

48:44.087 --> 48:45.130
Tell me.

48:45.213 --> 48:46.340
Stop. No.

48:48.550 --> 48:49.843
You slept with Cheong-san, didn't you?

48:51.053 --> 48:52.846
You did. I got it, am I right?

48:52.929 --> 48:54.222
-Are you insane?
-Ow!

48:54.306 --> 48:56.141
[whispers]
I told Su-hyeok I like him.

48:56.725 --> 48:58.018
What?

48:59.144 --> 49:00.771
I told Su-hyeok I like him.

49:02.064 --> 49:03.273
You mean?

49:03.357 --> 49:05.317
-What?
-[male student] My gosh.

-You eat it. It's okay.
-What?

49:18.747 --> 49:20.707
How'd you do it? What did you say?
Did you ask him on a date or what?

49:21.375 --> 49:22.209
My name tag.

49:22.292 --> 49:23.460
[chuckles]

49:24.211 --> 49:25.545

So?

Well, that's all.

49:33.011 --> 49:33.845
Huh?

49:34.930 --> 49:36.056
He didn't say anything?

-Mm-hm.
-Not even a vibe?

49:38.225 --> 49:39.351
Mm-hm.

You couldn't tell how he felt or anything?

Do you wanna go visit Hyeon-ju later?

Why?

50:22.185 --> 50:23.228
You're our class president.

50:24.271 --> 50:25.897
You know my mom made me class president

50:25.981 --> 50:28.108
by donating a bunch
of money to the school.

50:28.900 --> 50:32.738
That's why no one else thinks of me
as the real class president.

50:33.822 --> 50:35.615

I've actually never heard you talk
that much before.

54:07.494 --> 54:08.536
Don't do it.

54:10.622 --> 54:11.790
[Eun-ji] Wanna come up?

54:12.374 --> 54:13.291
Eun-ji.

54:13.375 --> 54:15.794
Uh, come down.
Let's just talk down here, please.

54:15.877 --> 54:17.128
Come on.

54:17.212 --> 54:18.088
They said…

54:19.631 --> 54:20.966
they'll gonna post it online.

54:21.049 --> 54:22.175
Huh? No.

54:23.009 --> 54:24.386
[stammers]
They said they delete it.

54:24.469 --> 54:26.304
They, they promised me they would.

54:26.888 --> 54:27.889
This is a living hell.

54:29.099 --> 54:30.892
So I'm just trying to escape from hell.

54:30.976 --> 54:32.310
[Cheol-su] I'll take care of it.

54:32.394 --> 54:33.728
I can do it.

54:34.771 --> 54:36.189

I'll delete them all.

Just…

Please don't…
[sobs]

54:40.694 --> 54:43.488

Please don't do it, Eun-ji.

54:53.039 --> 54:54.082
Do you…

like me?

Two losers who liked each other,
that's hilarious.

55:17.230 --> 55:19.816
But when two losers go out,
they get even lamer.

55:23.945 --> 55:25.238
So stay away from me.

55:26.448 --> 55:27.699
Eun-ji.

55:27.782 --> 55:29.409
[Eun-ji] And stay away from…

[indistinct chattering]

56:35.058 --> 56:36.142
I have a great idea.

56:36.768 --> 56:37.977
Just ask Cheong-san.

56:38.520 --> 56:39.854
Forget it.

56:39.938 --> 56:42.774
Seriously, he and Su-hyeok
are really close.

56:42.857 --> 56:45.276
Why don't you
just ask Cheong-san how he feels?

56:45.360 --> 56:46.569
[scoffs]
No.

56:47.695 --> 56:49.781
On-jo. You have to listen to me.

56:50.490 --> 56:53.076
There's a good chance Su-hyeok
already told him everything.

56:53.576 --> 56:55.745
It doesn't matter. He'll make fun of me.

56:57.372 --> 56:58.581
Put mine away too, gopher.

56:58.665 --> 56:59.958
[I-sak] Hey, Cheong-san.

57:00.959 --> 57:02.085
On-jo needs to talk to you.

57:04.712 --> 57:07.715
Hey. So, you're close to Su-hyeok, right?

57:07.799 --> 57:09.551
For sure. Why?

57:10.468 --> 57:11.469
Told you?

57:13.096 --> 57:13.972
What is it?

57:15.056 --> 57:16.349
Nothing. So get lost.

57:17.183 --> 57:19.352
-[I-sak] So, On-jo--
-Hey.

57:19.936 --> 57:21.312
[whispers]
You're dead.

57:21.396 --> 57:22.355
Understood.

57:23.356 --> 57:26.192
Hey. A real friend
would help out right now.

57:28.987 --> 57:29.904
[whispers]
What is it?

57:33.450 --> 57:34.576
[scoffs]

57:34.659 --> 57:36.828
Wait a second? Did Su-hyeok say something?

57:36.911 --> 57:37.745
No.

57:38.997 --> 57:39.914
Did you fight?

57:40.457 --> 57:41.583
I just said no.

57:42.417 --> 57:45.378
Then what's going on,
did he say that he likes you?

57:46.629 --> 57:48.006
Did he say that?

57:48.089 --> 57:49.716
-What?
-That he likes me?

57:50.300 --> 57:51.301
Who? Su-hyeok?

57:53.219 --> 57:55.680
No? He didn't say anything?

57:55.763 --> 57:58.016
Hmm, what are you talking about?

57:58.808 --> 57:59.893
Earlier…

58:02.270 --> 58:04.606
-You can't tell anyone, okay?
-About what?

58:04.689 --> 58:06.024
You really can't tell anyone.

58:06.107 --> 58:07.442
About what, On-jo?

58:09.277 --> 58:12.780
I asked him out earlier, but I don't know.

58:12.864 --> 58:14.282
[On-jo] He hasn't said anything.

58:19.621 --> 58:20.538
Hey.

58:20.622 --> 58:21.873
Yeah, what?

58:21.956 --> 58:25.084
Any chance you could ask him
what he thinks about me?

58:25.668 --> 58:26.794
[laughs awkwardly]

58:26.878 --> 58:27.921
We're not close.

58:29.589 --> 58:30.715
Yeah, you are.

58:31.508 --> 58:32.759
No, we're not, really.

58:34.969 --> 58:36.679
Can't you help me out for once?

58:37.347 --> 58:38.556
You're not my friend.
