00:54.291 --> 00:57.375
On October 13, 1972,

00:57.458 --> 01:00.875
an Uruguayan plane
crashed in the Andean Mountain Range.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.875
Forty of us passengers
and five crew members

01:05.958 --> 01:07.416
were on board the plane.

01:10.208 --> 01:12.125
Some say it was a tragedy.

01:14.416 --> 01:16.250
Others call it a miracle.

01:19.458 --> 01:21.125
What really happened?

01:23.083 --> 01:25.500
What happens when the world abandons you?

01:27.833 --> 01:31.083
When you have no clothes…
and you're freezing?

01:33.500 --> 01:36.125
When you have no food, and you're dying?

01:40.500 --> 01:42.416
The answer's in the mountain.

01:44.458 --> 01:46.291
We have to go back to the past

01:46.833 --> 01:49.916
to understand that the past
is what changes the most.

01:54.666 --> 01:56.416
MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY
OCTOBER 1972

01:56.500 --> 01:58.166
Let's go! Get in there!

01:58.250 --> 02:01.791
C'mon, Olds! Yeah! Come on! We got this!

02:01.875 --> 02:03.125
That ball's ours! Push!

02:05.541 --> 02:08.375
Go, Christians!

02:08.458 --> 02:11.958
C'mon, Christians! Push!

02:12.041 --> 02:14.500
Get in there! Let's go! Let's go!

02:14.583 --> 02:16.458
Get it! Come on!

02:16.541 --> 02:18.500
Go, Roberto!

02:22.333 --> 02:23.333
Pass it to Nando!

02:23.916 --> 02:24.875
Roberto, pass it!

02:26.166 --> 02:28.000
-To Nando!
-Come on!

02:29.958 --> 02:32.458
Pass it! Roberto, pass it!

02:33.375 --> 02:34.500
Pass it!

02:39.958 --> 02:40.958
Pass it.

02:42.958 --> 02:45.458
There were four players ahead of you.
I couldn't pass.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.500
-You could have, but you thought too much.
-You gotta think less and do more.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.791
-You couldn't have done better.
-Couldn't have done worse.

02:50.875 --> 02:52.958
I messed up once!
We won the last cup because of me.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.125
Because of you?

02:56.875 --> 02:58.875
All right, all right! Knock it off!

02:58.958 --> 03:01.208
Hey. What's so funny, huh? Today's score?

03:02.458 --> 03:04.333
Roberto, you trust me, right?

03:04.416 --> 03:08.166
So, when I say,
"Pass it," you pass it. Okay?

03:08.250 --> 03:11.416
And when I say the trip money
is due today, I expect it today!

03:11.500 --> 03:15.166
Okay? We have half a plane to fill.
Dan, is your cousin coming?

03:15.250 --> 03:17.541
-Yeah. It'll be the four of us.
-Our money.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.375
No envelope? Great, Coco.

03:19.458 --> 03:21.500
-No.
-Anybody else, then?

03:21.583 --> 03:23.000
Gastón, are your friends in?

03:23.083 --> 03:25.583
-Yeah. I convinced them.
-You're sure?

03:25.666 --> 03:27.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, except one.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.583
"'You are my beloved Son,'
He said."

03:30.666 --> 03:34.375
"And at once, the Spirit
drove Jesus out into the desert."

03:34.458 --> 03:38.833
"And He remained in the desert
for 40 days and nights,

03:38.916 --> 03:41.875
being tempted by Satan at all times."

03:41.958 --> 03:43.833
"'If you are the Son of God,

03:43.916 --> 03:47.291
tell these stones
to become bread,' the tempter said."

03:47.791 --> 03:52.000
"But Jesus answered,
'Man shall not live on bread alone…'"

03:52.083 --> 03:53.333
Psst!

03:54.041 --> 03:55.041
Pancho.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.041
Pancho!

03:57.125 --> 03:59.750
…and gave it
to them, saying, "This is my body…"

03:59.833 --> 04:02.041
Pancho, for Numa. Numa.

04:02.125 --> 04:06.958
We proclaim your death,
O Lord, and profess your resurrection

04:07.041 --> 04:09.291
until you come again, Jesus.

04:09.375 --> 04:12.458
Come on, Alfredo.

04:12.541 --> 04:14.083
Hey! You!

04:14.166 --> 04:16.583
Come here. Come here. Come here.

04:16.666 --> 04:18.708
Hand this paper to Pancho. Right there.

04:22.541 --> 04:23.666
Thanks.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.458
Psst, Numa.

04:26.541 --> 04:28.750
Excuse me. Can you hand this to him?

04:29.958 --> 04:31.041
Gastón.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.750
COME TO CHILE, MAN!

04:39.833 --> 04:43.208
Workers and students,
hand in hand, we stand!

04:43.291 --> 04:47.333
Workers and students,
hand in hand, we stand!

04:47.416 --> 04:49.208
No, it's the final Commercial Law test.

04:49.291 --> 04:52.000
-I can't go.
-No! It's gonna get postponed anyway.

04:52.083 --> 04:55.083
-For two weeks. Just look outside!
-It's not about the test.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.375
-I don't care about rugby.
-Rugby? Rugby's the least of it!

04:58.458 --> 05:02.291
Santiago de Chile, $45.
You'll never find a cheaper ticket.

05:02.375 --> 05:04.625
-Never!
-In your life!

05:04.708 --> 05:05.916
Do you know what this is?

05:06.000 --> 05:09.333
This little list here has all the numbers
of the girls we've met there.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.375
-Graciela…
-Flamboyant.

05:12.458 --> 05:14.250
-Silvia…
-Fine.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.125
-Beatriz…
-A lioness.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.750
-Nélida…
-No, not her.

05:17.833 --> 05:19.458
What? Nélida's amazing. Knock it off.

05:19.541 --> 05:22.625
Nélida messed you up,
left you crying all around Montevideo.

05:22.708 --> 05:25.333
-Whoa! What is wrong with you?
-No, no…

05:25.416 --> 05:27.750
You keep this thing.
Don't let Gastón touch it.

05:27.833 --> 05:31.000
Okay? Let's go grab another drink.
Come on.

05:31.541 --> 05:35.250
-Stop. What is wrong with you?
-You gotta relax.

05:35.333 --> 05:38.541
Don't let me travel with these two morons.
Please. I beg of you.

05:38.625 --> 05:41.250
You're not gonna convince me,
Pancho.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.625
-Want a good argument to talk you into it?
-Do it.

05:43.708 --> 05:45.083
I really want you to go.

05:45.958 --> 05:49.500
'Cause you graduate in a couple of months,
and you'll start working nonstop.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.958
You'll be the best lawyer in all
of Montevideo, and we'll be proud of you.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.750
But we're gonna have different lives.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.333
This may actually be
the last trip we take together, you know?

05:59.583 --> 06:02.583
You trying to make me cry, man?

06:02.666 --> 06:06.291
Workers and students,
hand in hand, we stand!

06:14.458 --> 06:16.458
Good evening.

06:25.708 --> 06:28.583
Who's a good boy?
How's it goin', buddy?

07:06.166 --> 07:07.041
Champ.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.375
What do you think?

07:10.250 --> 07:12.458
Should we go?

07:25.083 --> 07:28.708
It's eight o'clock
this Thursday morning in Montevideo.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.208
Jackass!

07:31.291 --> 07:34.666
This is Berch Rupenian
from Impactos on Independencia Radio.

07:35.458 --> 07:38.125
We're here, kicking off
this four-day long weekend

07:38.208 --> 07:40.958
with a forecast of sunshine
and nice weather

07:41.041 --> 07:43.416
to make your weekend even better.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.375
Oh, Panchito.

07:56.708 --> 07:59.291
Have a good one.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.291
Honey, can you help me
find the boys, please?

08:06.375 --> 08:07.958
Numa!

08:10.125 --> 08:11.541
Hey.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.625
Let's do it.

08:12.708 --> 08:15.125
Canessa! Roberto Canessa!

08:15.208 --> 08:16.875
Alexis. Alexis Hounié!

08:16.958 --> 08:18.458
Enrique Platero.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.875
Felipe Maquirriain.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.833
Francisco Abal. Pancho.

08:21.916 --> 08:22.791
Bye.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.458
-Goodbye.
-Okay. Let's go.

08:24.541 --> 08:25.750
Bye-bye.

08:25.833 --> 08:26.708
-Bye.
-Mwah!

08:26.791 --> 08:27.916
-Be good.
-Okay.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.750
-Okay?
-Kiss Mommy.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.250
-See you! Bye-bye. I love you.
-Love you, Mom. We'll miss you.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.125
One. Two.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.250
-Javier, smile.
-Three.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.083
-Done.
-Let's go!

08:40.166 --> 08:41.750
Bravo!

08:43.125 --> 08:44.250
Did you hear it click?

08:44.333 --> 08:45.583
-Yeah, I got it.
-Perfect.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.583
Dude!

08:50.250 --> 08:52.208
My name is Numa Turcatti.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.916
I'm 24 years old.

08:55.416 --> 08:57.083
It's great that all these guys get to go.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.666
I look around,
and I barely know anyone here…

09:02.500 --> 09:05.166
but at the same time,
it all feels familiar.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.541
Most of them are young, like me.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.458
Lovingly raised in houses near the sea.

09:13.541 --> 09:14.583
Hey!

09:16.125 --> 09:20.541
For some of them,
it's their first trip away from home.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.541
Sit down! Carlitos, stop! Just sit down!

09:32.625 --> 09:34.625
Come on!

09:35.458 --> 09:37.208
Yeah, you're very talented.
Sit down.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.208
Could be anything.

09:55.583 --> 09:56.958
Coco, look at the camera.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.916
Looks good.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.958
Hey! Hey, Diego! Come on!

10:10.958 --> 10:12.666
Hey. That's a pretty nice hand, man.

10:14.791 --> 10:16.958
Dude, your cousin--

10:17.041 --> 10:20.625
Opa! We just got bitten by the shark.

10:20.708 --> 10:22.041
The mountain range, huh?

10:22.125 --> 10:25.083
Is it true these mountains try to suck up
anyone who passes over them?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.333
Yeah. It's true.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.583
The warm winds
from the plains of Argentina

10:31.666 --> 10:33.583
collide with the cold winds
of the mountains

10:33.666 --> 10:34.875
and create a suction effect.

10:34.958 --> 10:36.416
Nah. You're joking.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.583
I'm not joking.
That's why there's turbulence.

10:39.666 --> 10:42.000
But, you know, we're one step ahead.

10:42.083 --> 10:42.958
Check it out.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.750
This is the mountain range.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.458
And now, we have to go from here.

10:52.541 --> 10:54.416
But the route isn't a straight line.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.666
Look. You can't cross it just like that.
The range is massive.

10:57.750 --> 11:02.750
That's why we have to travel south,
looking for a lower passage through it.

11:03.250 --> 11:07.458
We cross it, and once in Chile,
we just turn north in Curicó.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.625
And in ten minutes,
we'll be landing in Santiago.

11:14.625 --> 11:17.333
Attention, passengers.
Please fasten your seat belts.

11:17.416 --> 11:21.208
-In a few minutes, we'll be in Santiago.
-Go and deal the cards, okay?

11:21.291 --> 11:23.666
Arturo!

11:39.958 --> 11:44.375
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain, General Carlos Páez.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.791
Everybody, please fasten your seat belts.

11:46.875 --> 11:48.875
Bodies are not allowed
to be scattered in the Andes.

11:50.250 --> 11:53.000
Please recommend Casapueblo Airlines
for the forthcoming flights!

11:53.083 --> 11:54.750
Sit down! Sit down!

11:54.833 --> 11:56.416
Stay there.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.916
-Bravo!
-Carlitos! Carlitos!

12:00.000 --> 12:02.416
Stop. Fasten your seat belt, okay?

12:03.375 --> 12:06.291
Go to the front.
I need some room to sit down.

12:06.833 --> 12:08.083
Come on.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.458
Sit down. I'll be right there.

12:36.708 --> 12:39.083
Hey! What's the matter? You scared?

12:45.458 --> 12:47.541
Careful, Javier. Grab my hand.

12:47.625 --> 12:50.500
Nando. Nando. Your seat belt.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.500
-No! Sit back down. Sit down.
-I gotta get there.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.583
Nando! Nando!

12:59.666 --> 13:01.250
-Susy!
-Don't get up!

13:22.916 --> 13:24.833
More power! Give it power!

13:34.000 --> 13:35.708
No, no!

13:45.416 --> 13:48.208
-Our Father, who art in heaven…
-I don't wanna die here!

13:48.291 --> 13:49.708
Hail Mary, full of grace…

14:07.916 --> 14:09.416
Gastón!

15:42.166 --> 15:44.000
Give me your hand, Roberto.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.250
I'm down here!

15:50.791 --> 15:52.708
Eduardo. Eduardo. Eduardo.

15:52.791 --> 15:54.166
-Shh.
-Marcelo.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.583
Yeah, man. Yeah. I'm right here. I'm here.

16:01.541 --> 16:04.625
I don't want
anyone else to die!

16:04.708 --> 16:09.000
I don't want anyone else to die!
I don't want anyone else to die!

16:09.708 --> 16:12.541
Put him against the wall.
Okay, that's great. Lift him up.

16:14.416 --> 16:17.041
That's it. I need you to be calm.
Relax, relax. Now, breathe.

16:17.125 --> 16:20.458
Look into my eyes.
Look into my eyes. I study medicine.

16:20.541 --> 16:22.333
I'm Roberto. What's your name?

16:22.416 --> 16:23.833
-Álvaro.
-Álvaro what?

16:23.916 --> 16:26.041
Álvaro… Álvaro--

16:34.750 --> 16:36.666
Please wake up!

16:36.750 --> 16:39.041
The pilot's alive! Here, help me.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.500
The pilot is alive!

16:40.583 --> 16:41.916
Come on, Gustavo.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.625
On three, okay? One, two, three.

16:45.708 --> 16:46.958
This way. Here.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.458
DAY 1
OCTOBER 13, 1972

16:49.625 --> 16:51.291
Right here.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.041
Nothing's turning on. Not even the lights.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.416
I need you to tell me how the radio works.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.416
What? What do I press?

17:04.041 --> 17:07.291
Hello? We crashed in the mountains.
We're Uruguayans.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.750
We crashed in the mountains.
Is anybody there?

17:10.375 --> 17:11.458
Does this even work?

17:11.541 --> 17:14.708
-Huh? What?
-We passed Curicó.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.208
What do you mean?

17:16.291 --> 17:17.833
We're past Curicó.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.250
What about Curicó?

17:20.333 --> 17:22.458
Say it again. Come on.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.125
Hey!

17:46.708 --> 17:48.833
May… may God be with you.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.583
The night hits like an ambush.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.541
In the span of minutes,
temperature drops 86 degrees.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.916
If the plane crash didn't kill us,
the cold will.

18:17.666 --> 18:19.791
We huddle together the best we can.

18:20.875 --> 18:23.666
Living and dead… as one.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.375
I'm going home now.

18:38.458 --> 18:41.541
Your passport! Give me your passport!
Your passport!

18:42.333 --> 18:43.875
Grab my hand tighter.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.625
That's how we spend the night.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.958
Nobody fall asleep!
You'll freeze to death!

18:49.041 --> 18:51.458
-The injured scream.
-Come on!

18:51.541 --> 18:53.500
So do the rest of us.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.041
Let go of me! Mommy!

18:56.666 --> 18:58.208
Mommy!

18:58.291 --> 18:59.166
Hold me.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.416
Tighter, Pancho.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.625
Help me. Help me.

19:12.708 --> 19:14.875
Help.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.625
Help!

20:01.083 --> 20:04.291
We're still alive, Pancho.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.166
You got another one?

21:11.666 --> 21:12.791
Do we know where we are?

21:14.083 --> 21:15.166
No, not yet.

21:15.666 --> 21:18.833
Marcelo. We lost three more.
Pancho Abal and Martínez Lamas.

21:18.916 --> 21:20.791
And the lady who was screaming.

21:21.916 --> 21:24.333
Gastón got sucked out
when the tail broke off.

21:25.041 --> 21:29.208
Also, my cousin Daniel
and Guido and Alexis.

21:30.416 --> 21:31.625
Nando may not make it.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.291
His sister's really weak.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
We don't have anywhere
to take care of the injured.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.750
Let's make room inside the plane.

21:40.916 --> 21:43.875
Let's take out the seats
so we can all fit in there.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.083
C'mon, guys. C'mon.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.708
We need
to prioritize the injured.

21:54.791 --> 21:58.000
So let's clean up this side of the plane.
That's where the sun is.

21:58.083 --> 22:01.916
We'll take anyone who's hurt over there
and help them as much as we can.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
-Platero!
-Yeah?

22:05.583 --> 22:09.000
Anything you find that might be useful,
put in a suitcase. Okay?

22:09.083 --> 22:10.958
See if you can find
any food in the luggage.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.333
Anything you find,
put in a single suitcase.

22:22.291 --> 22:23.666
Bobby. Bobby.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.208
What do we do with the dead?

22:26.166 --> 22:29.416
We put them over there, on that side.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.916
Until rescue comes.

Here, take one, okay?

We gotta make it last.

23:50.625 --> 23:52.000
Hey!

23:53.166 --> 23:55.000
Hey!

23:55.083 --> 23:57.000
Help!

23:57.083 --> 23:59.458
-Help!
-Hey!

23:59.541 --> 24:01.500
Over here!

24:02.166 --> 24:08.083
DAY 2
OCTOBER 14, 1972

24:08.916 --> 24:11.833
-Wait. Stop.
-No. Isn't there a bigger one?

24:11.916 --> 24:14.583
-That one there. Roy!
-No! Don't touch it.

24:14.666 --> 24:17.291
See if you can find rags,
coats, clothes.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.458
Here. Take it.

24:20.541 --> 24:22.125
Come on.

24:22.208 --> 24:24.875
-Look for fabric, clothes…
-Give me that one.

24:24.958 --> 24:28.083
Coco! Take this. It's bigger.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.541
How many are gonna die tonight?

24:30.666 --> 24:32.291
No one's gonna die, Carlitos.

24:32.958 --> 24:34.208
I promise.

24:34.291 --> 24:36.125
Pancho! More bags!

24:40.833 --> 24:43.708
Here, cover all those holes
so that the cold doesn't get in at night.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.625
Marcelo.

25:07.041 --> 25:08.291
They're coming.

25:12.666 --> 25:13.833
Tomorrow.

25:20.791 --> 25:23.666
Fito Strauch
isn't as optimistic as Marcelo.

25:24.458 --> 25:25.833
He's a reasonable man.

25:26.708 --> 25:28.791
He would never go against the captain.

25:31.041 --> 25:33.083
But he doesn't like what he sees.

25:36.291 --> 25:39.083
This is a place where life is impossible.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.083
Out here, we are an anomaly.

25:48.375 --> 25:55.291
DAY 3
OCTOBER 15, 1972

25:56.958 --> 26:00.500
Nando. Nando.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.416
No. No. Uh, Nando… Don't.

26:08.916 --> 26:11.708
Shit.

26:11.791 --> 26:13.708
-Here. Take it.
-Give me that. Thanks.

26:16.791 --> 26:19.083
I can't hear you.

26:20.791 --> 26:22.041
What happened?

26:23.541 --> 26:24.750
Plane crashed.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.500
My sister?

26:28.833 --> 26:29.708
Susy?

26:30.291 --> 26:32.041
Susy's over there, resting.

26:53.666 --> 26:54.958
Where's my mom?

26:57.125 --> 26:58.666
Your mom died, Nando.

27:12.708 --> 27:15.208
-Bye, Dad.
-See you Monday. Take care of them.

27:15.291 --> 27:16.125
Yeah, yeah.

27:17.416 --> 27:18.500
I got it.

27:27.666 --> 27:30.625
-How long have we been here?
-Three days.

27:37.583 --> 27:38.708
They seen us?

28:13.458 --> 28:15.375
Give me that. Okay. Thanks.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.333
Hey!

28:35.416 --> 28:37.833
-Over here!
-Hey! It rocked its wings! They saw us!

28:37.916 --> 28:39.541
-They saw us!
-The wings moved!

28:41.375 --> 28:42.708
-Over here!
-Whoo-hoo!

28:59.666 --> 29:01.375
Do you know what I'd love to eat?

29:02.375 --> 29:04.625
A chivito from Arocena's.

29:04.708 --> 29:06.333
A full-stuffed Canadian chivito?

29:06.416 --> 29:08.416
A milanesa from La Mascota.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.750
-Oh yeah. That'd be great.
-Oh. Fries on the side.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.500
-I love their milanesas. So good.
-They're the best.

29:14.583 --> 29:17.500
Incredible. And the size
of the milanesas of La Mascota.

29:17.583 --> 29:20.958
-Fries… and ham. Bacon.
-Hey.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.166
They could've dropped
some food from the plane, right?

29:27.541 --> 29:29.125
Well, that wouldn't make sense.

29:30.541 --> 29:33.250
If they drop a package like that,
it'd sink in the snow.

29:33.333 --> 29:34.875
We'd never get it.

29:49.208 --> 29:50.625
Bring in the injured.

29:50.708 --> 29:52.625
Easy. Easy. Okay.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.458
Careful with his legs. Right there.

29:54.541 --> 29:58.416
You'll be better there, Arturo. Easy.

30:07.750 --> 30:09.750
It's getting closer.

30:09.833 --> 30:13.291
I don't see anything.

30:13.375 --> 30:15.791
-Yeah. Me neither.
-You see something?

30:15.875 --> 30:17.083
I don't see it.

30:34.250 --> 30:35.875
The Andes are massive.

30:36.833 --> 30:39.541
They must be organizing
the search somehow.

30:39.625 --> 30:40.958
By zone.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.791
Yesterday, they were here.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.375
We saw them fly over.

30:45.291 --> 30:47.125
We heard them today,
but we couldn't see them.

30:47.208 --> 30:49.083
They're probably searching somewhere else.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.708
If they're looking, they didn't see us.

30:51.416 --> 30:52.416
They're coming.

30:53.458 --> 30:56.583
-We need to have faith.
-Faith? What faith?

30:57.083 --> 30:59.875
Don't talk this way
in front of the younger guys.

30:59.958 --> 31:01.916
If you tell them,
you'll destroy their morale.

31:02.750 --> 31:06.083
You guys are the oldest ones here,
and you have a responsibility.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.916
They will rescue us.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.541
-We won't last like this.
-How long can we survive?

31:20.250 --> 31:22.208
-Know the rule of three?
-No.

31:22.291 --> 31:24.000
Three minutes without air,

31:24.083 --> 31:26.958
three days without water,
and three weeks without food.

31:27.041 --> 31:28.791
Three weeks without food?

31:28.875 --> 31:30.666
I haven't eaten in three days.
I'm starving.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.625
It's a lot worse here.
There's the altitude and the cold.

31:33.708 --> 31:36.458
We're burning three
or four times as many calories.

31:36.541 --> 31:38.541
Roque told us about the batteries.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.875
They were in the tail of the plane.

31:41.833 --> 31:45.583
In my opinion, we should go up there,
where the plane crashed,

31:46.083 --> 31:47.750
and get the radio working.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.125
We gotta keep going!

32:59.208 --> 33:00.250
The snow is still firm!

33:00.333 --> 33:03.416
-Let's take advantage of that!
-Numa! Save your energy!

33:03.500 --> 33:06.125
I don't want to carry you back.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.625
Fito.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.125
What happened?

33:14.416 --> 33:16.166
You can't see the plane.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.250
They won't find it,
even if they fly over us.

33:44.833 --> 33:45.791
We're going back!

33:52.125 --> 33:54.208
It's been six days without food.

33:58.666 --> 34:01.166
Last night,
we split what we had left.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.708
A pack of crackers.

34:04.458 --> 34:05.750
There's nothing else.

35:24.416 --> 35:26.583
Carlitos came over
to tell me something.

35:28.625 --> 35:30.958
He says that Nando's losing his mind.

35:31.625 --> 35:34.958
Last night, he went up to him
and said he wasn't gonna starve to death.

35:35.041 --> 35:36.541
I'm not gonna starve to death.

35:36.625 --> 35:38.541
That he'd eat the bodies
if he had to.

35:38.625 --> 35:40.833
If I have to, I'll eat the bodies.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.208
I told him
that we don't have another option.

36:01.375 --> 36:03.958
If we wanna get rescued,
we gotta stay alive.

36:07.083 --> 36:09.208
And to stay alive, we need to eat.

36:36.708 --> 36:37.708
Marcelo.

36:40.458 --> 36:42.041
We're dying.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.208
We're starving, and they're not coming.

36:47.083 --> 36:50.791
-We're wasting ourselves away.
-Seven days and nights without food.

36:51.291 --> 36:53.875
Nothing. If we don't eat, we're gonna die.

36:54.541 --> 36:55.625
Eat what?

36:58.708 --> 37:00.458
Are you crazy, Roberto?

37:00.541 --> 37:02.666
You gonna make everyone else crazy too?

37:02.750 --> 37:03.916
There's food outside.

37:10.916 --> 37:13.166
There's protein outside.
Energy that we need.

37:13.250 --> 37:15.041
Do you know what's crazy?
To go on like this!

37:15.125 --> 37:16.125
Roberto!

37:19.583 --> 37:22.500
Roberto's right. We're talking
about living or dying, Marcelo.

37:22.583 --> 37:25.208
And if help arrives
in two days, then what, Fito?

37:25.291 --> 37:26.875
Can't we wait a couple more days?

37:26.958 --> 37:29.375
-Know what happens when you stop eating?
-Roberto!

37:32.583 --> 37:34.208
The body dries out. Just like plants.

37:34.291 --> 37:36.916
You can't use your brain.
Because it dries out too, Marcelo.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.583
-My pee is black.
-Yeah, my pee is black too.

37:39.666 --> 37:40.958
If we do it…

37:42.541 --> 37:44.750
what will happen to us?
Will God forgive us?

37:44.833 --> 37:47.500
God put us in this situation.
He'll understand we need to survive.

37:47.583 --> 37:49.583
God has nothing to do with this.

37:49.666 --> 37:51.125
I'm sorry, Marcelo.

37:51.208 --> 37:52.875
It's luck that brought us here.

37:52.958 --> 37:54.375
-Bad luck.
-It's meat.

37:54.458 --> 37:57.375
-It's people we love, Arturo.
-And how do you cut up a body?

37:58.125 --> 37:59.666
And who would even do it?

38:02.750 --> 38:05.083
Me.

38:07.291 --> 38:08.458
I'll do it.

38:08.958 --> 38:11.583
-I will too.
-I'm not eating them.

38:12.625 --> 38:14.250
That's something I refuse to do.

38:15.541 --> 38:17.666
Is it legal to eat a dead person?

38:18.166 --> 38:19.916
Won't we go to prison if we do it?

38:20.416 --> 38:23.291
-It would be like organ donation.
-What's wrong with you?

38:23.375 --> 38:27.333
For it to be organ donation,
you need to have the donor's consent.

38:27.416 --> 38:29.375
It's a crime, Marcelo.

38:29.458 --> 38:33.208
We can't just take, defile, and desecrate
someone's body without consent.

38:33.291 --> 38:35.791
-We need to eat, Numa.
-We don't have the right to.

38:35.875 --> 38:38.791
And don't I have the right
to do everything I can to survive?

38:42.125 --> 38:43.875
Who's gonna take that from me? You?

40:58.333 --> 40:59.375
Susy?

41:00.666 --> 41:02.583
Susy. Susy, breathe.

41:03.166 --> 41:04.833
No, no, no. Susana.

41:05.333 --> 41:08.250
Susana, come on. No. No. Gustavo!

41:08.875 --> 41:10.333
Gustavo, help me, please.

41:10.875 --> 41:13.583
-Susana. Please help me!
-What's wrong?

41:13.666 --> 41:15.291
She's not breathing. I don't know.

41:15.375 --> 41:17.875
Okay. Put her legs over there.
I'll hold her head.

41:17.958 --> 41:20.583
Roberto.
She's not breathing, Roberto.

41:20.666 --> 41:22.625
-Help her.
-Bring her here. Right there.

41:23.291 --> 41:25.541
Help me, Gustavo! Hurry!

41:25.625 --> 41:27.958
-She's not breathing.
-Susy!

41:28.708 --> 41:30.958
Coco Nicolich
wrote a letter to his parents.

41:35.166 --> 41:36.583
"Dear Mom and Dad,

41:37.708 --> 41:40.916
I'm writing to you
eight days after the plane crashed."

41:45.208 --> 41:46.833
"We're in a beautiful place,

41:47.833 --> 41:51.333
completely surrounded by mountains,
with a lake nearby,

41:51.416 --> 41:53.958
that will unfreeze when the thaw starts."

41:56.041 --> 41:57.250
"We're all doing fine."

41:58.541 --> 42:01.208
"As of now, there are 27 survivors."

42:03.083 --> 42:06.083
"Nando Parrado's sister
passed away today."

42:08.666 --> 42:10.208
"I miss you very much."

42:13.250 --> 42:15.458
"And I'm constantly praying to God,

42:17.125 --> 42:20.708
that he at least
lets me see you one last time."

42:41.291 --> 42:42.791
This is a cemetery.

42:48.958 --> 42:50.541
And I'm not staying here.

43:00.041 --> 43:02.000
It hurts! My stomach hurts!

43:02.083 --> 43:04.250
I know, Moncho.
You need to calm down.

43:04.333 --> 43:06.291
-Just breathe.
-I can't breathe.

43:06.375 --> 43:09.291
Look at me, Moncho. Look at me. Breathe.

43:09.375 --> 43:10.791
-I don't want to!
-Just breathe.

43:10.875 --> 43:13.500
-I can't! I can't! Help me!
-Yes, you can.

43:13.583 --> 43:14.583
Look at me and breathe!

43:14.666 --> 43:17.000
I gotta get outta here!
I'm suffocating!

43:17.083 --> 43:20.125
You can't go outside now, Moncho.
Look at me. You have to calm down.

43:20.208 --> 43:22.833
-I don't want to die here.
-You're not going to die.

43:22.916 --> 43:25.666
-I don't want to die here!
-You're not dying, Moncho.

43:26.416 --> 43:30.541
DAY 9
OCTOBER 21, 1972

43:41.958 --> 43:44.833
If I die,
I give you permission to feed on my body.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.000
So you can keep on living.

43:55.541 --> 43:57.750
I give you my consent as well.

43:58.333 --> 43:59.333
And you have mine.

44:00.333 --> 44:01.708
You also have my permission.

44:26.166 --> 44:29.375
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

44:29.458 --> 44:33.916
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.416
Give us this day our daily bread.

44:35.500 --> 44:36.666
And forgive us our trespasses

44:36.750 --> 44:38.833
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

44:38.916 --> 44:41.666
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

44:41.750 --> 44:44.000
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

44:44.083 --> 44:44.958
Thy kingdom come.

44:45.041 --> 44:47.000
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

44:47.083 --> 44:49.000
Give us this day our daily bread.

44:49.083 --> 44:50.541
And forgive us our trespasses

44:50.625 --> 44:52.750
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

44:52.833 --> 44:56.166
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

44:56.250 --> 44:57.958
On earth as it is in heaven.

44:58.041 --> 45:00.541
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses.

45:00.625 --> 45:02.875
And lead us not into temptation.

45:02.958 --> 45:04.791
But deliver us from evil. Amen.

45:24.125 --> 45:26.000
I'm sorry.

45:34.125 --> 45:35.541
Sorry, Marcelo.

45:39.208 --> 45:40.666
Sorry, Marcelo.

45:44.750 --> 45:46.166
Will God forgive us?

45:48.083 --> 45:50.666
We don't have a choice.
I'm sorry, Marcelo.

46:47.166 --> 46:49.500
Don't give me
that look, Coche.

46:52.875 --> 46:54.791
I'm not giving you a look.

47:15.791 --> 47:18.875
The Strauch cousins
have the most difficult job.

47:21.250 --> 47:22.958
The one no one wants to do.

47:24.625 --> 47:26.458
Fito chooses the bodies.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.916
And they cut them up in secret.

47:32.458 --> 47:34.375
Away from everyone else.

47:36.625 --> 47:39.291
That's how they keep
the ones who eat sane.

47:57.750 --> 47:58.708
Hey!

47:58.791 --> 48:00.750
-What?
-I found something!

48:05.125 --> 48:06.250
A radio!

48:09.416 --> 48:10.708
It's all wet.

48:11.208 --> 48:12.666
Come on, Roy. Fix it.

48:22.125 --> 48:24.583
Those of us who don't eat
keep watching the sky.

48:28.750 --> 48:30.250
Waiting for a sign.

48:40.666 --> 48:42.000
Left or right?

48:43.583 --> 48:44.458
Higher, Coco.

48:44.541 --> 48:46.458
If you want it higher,
we'll need to get more wire

48:46.541 --> 48:48.958
and tie it to a pole or something.

48:50.041 --> 48:53.250
Hold it there.
A little bit to the left.

48:54.625 --> 48:55.875
A bit more.

48:57.958 --> 49:00.083
Less. A little to the right.

49:00.166 --> 49:01.083
There.

49:22.791 --> 49:23.791
Take this.

49:27.291 --> 49:28.416
What is that?

49:30.125 --> 49:32.541
Eat it. It's easier with snow.

49:32.625 --> 49:33.916
No, thank you.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.416
I'll be okay.

49:38.583 --> 49:40.208
You have to eat, Numa.

49:44.625 --> 49:46.333
It's not right, Pancho.

49:50.333 --> 49:54.250
No!

49:59.875 --> 50:02.375
Why?!

50:02.458 --> 50:06.666
This is Spectator.
We're coming to you with new information.

50:06.750 --> 50:09.750
The search for the Uruguayan plane
that crashed in the Andean Mountain Range

50:09.833 --> 50:12.916
with the rugby team Old Christians,
has come to an end.

50:14.041 --> 50:16.083
In the ten days required by the protocol,

50:16.166 --> 50:19.375
66 search and rescue missions
were conducted,

50:19.458 --> 50:22.500
using 17 planes from the Chilean Air Force

50:22.583 --> 50:26.083
as well as aircrafts of the Uruguayan
and Argentinian Air Forces,

50:26.166 --> 50:27.916
but to no avail.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.708
Search efforts will resume
early next year,

50:31.791 --> 50:33.333
when the thawing of the ice will provide

50:33.416 --> 50:36.500
better conditions of visibility
to find the wreckage.

50:36.583 --> 50:38.875
The Chilean Air Force's rescue service

50:38.958 --> 50:42.916
has reported that, in the 34 air accidents
that have occurred in the Andes,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.166
no survivors have ever been found.

50:45.958 --> 50:48.666
We'll return with more news
after a commercial break.

50:52.166 --> 50:55.666
Made with premium quality parts.

50:55.750 --> 50:57.791
Beautiful colors and designs.

50:58.625 --> 51:01.708
Customizable,
with three different models.

51:01.791 --> 51:06.166
Bicicletas Victoria,
the leading bicycle brand.

51:08.083 --> 51:09.333
I was wrong.

51:11.708 --> 51:14.208
I begged you to wait
to be rescued for nothing.

51:18.041 --> 51:20.000
But if I can ask you for one more thing,

51:22.458 --> 51:24.000
I'm asking you to eat.

51:39.166 --> 51:41.333
The only thing we have left
is our life.

51:41.416 --> 51:43.500
And we have to fight for it.

51:54.791 --> 51:57.250
We went up to look
for the tail of the plane.

51:57.333 --> 51:58.708
Without telling anyone.

51:58.791 --> 52:00.000
With no plan.

52:01.375 --> 52:03.875
We need to find batteries for the radio.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Over there.

52:53.958 --> 52:55.333
I'm here, Gastón.

53:29.083 --> 53:31.250
That's Daniel Shaw, Fito's cousin.

53:31.916 --> 53:34.250
He was behind me on the plane
and flew out.

53:34.875 --> 53:36.291
Sun's going down.

53:36.375 --> 53:37.833
-We should go back.
-No.

53:39.083 --> 53:40.708
Let's look some more. Please.

53:41.791 --> 53:45.208
If we found all these things here,
the tail shouldn't be far behind.

54:01.166 --> 54:02.375
Who's up there?

54:03.291 --> 54:06.333
Numa, Gustavo, and Maspons.

54:07.958 --> 54:09.500
They left with nothing.

54:10.458 --> 54:12.958
The temperature up there
must drop 80 or 90 degrees.

54:13.875 --> 54:15.541
And it's gonna be night soon.

54:24.333 --> 54:27.333
The sun had melted the snow,
and we were knee-deep in it.

54:27.958 --> 54:30.083
No, that way!

54:38.333 --> 54:42.333
We can barely keep going,
and the night traps us.

54:45.875 --> 54:47.583
Everyone, get closer! Get closer.

54:51.958 --> 54:53.208
Calm down!

54:53.291 --> 54:54.750
Come on!

54:54.833 --> 54:56.750
Please, Lord,
don't let us freeze to death.

54:56.833 --> 54:59.166
Shake the ice off my back!

55:59.458 --> 56:01.708
The more we try to get out,

56:02.750 --> 56:04.666
the more the mountain resists.

56:18.708 --> 56:19.875
Hey!

56:27.125 --> 56:29.208
Gus, eat.

56:32.416 --> 56:33.541
So, Numa.

56:35.750 --> 56:37.000
What did you see up there?

56:42.791 --> 56:43.958
Numa.

56:44.041 --> 56:45.041
Tell me.

56:46.041 --> 56:47.791
Only snow and mountains.

56:48.458 --> 56:49.875
In every direction?

56:50.500 --> 56:53.958
As far as I could see,
that's all there is.

56:54.041 --> 56:54.875
And to the west?

56:55.750 --> 56:58.500
-See anything behind that ice wall?
-No.

57:00.791 --> 57:02.416
You can't see anything.

57:03.833 --> 57:05.083
Chile's right behind it.

57:07.375 --> 57:08.750
We need to go there.

57:11.166 --> 57:14.416
But you gotta eat, Numa.
Or you won't make it to Chile.

57:52.875 --> 57:53.875
Come on.

58:18.125 --> 58:20.791
I don't chew
more than two or three times.

58:22.875 --> 58:24.875
And I force myself to swallow.

58:35.083 --> 58:38.250
For the first time,
I imagine the possibility

58:38.333 --> 58:41.916
that feels increasingly real
of not getting back home.

58:45.333 --> 58:47.041
But I look at Nando, and I feel hope.

58:50.416 --> 58:53.166
He trains every day,
obsessed with one idea.

58:54.291 --> 58:58.625
Beyond that mountain
lie the green valleys of Chile.

59:00.458 --> 59:02.125
Climbing it is suicide.

59:08.833 --> 59:10.166
But I'm going with him.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.083
DAY 17
FIFTH DAY OF THE STORM

59:18.666 --> 59:20.208
Getting worse.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.750
Okay, Vasco. Check this out.

59:24.750 --> 59:26.625
'Cause your rhyme was all talk

59:28.500 --> 59:30.958
Tell me, why don't you get up
And go out for a quick walk?

59:32.666 --> 59:34.250
You're an idiot, Bobby!

59:34.333 --> 59:36.875
-Okay, Carlitos.
-Yeah, Carlitos.

59:36.958 --> 59:40.583
We can barely fit 27 of us
But that's all right

59:40.666 --> 59:43.958
While we're all cramped in here
Up in the presidential suite, they're fine

59:46.541 --> 59:48.875
While a terrible tragedy unfolds

59:48.958 --> 59:52.666
I want to escape
Yet I see many heroes without capes

59:52.750 --> 59:54.166
Aww.

59:54.250 --> 59:56.541
And although sometimes
Anger overtakes me

59:56.625 --> 59:59.500
Standing by your side
Truly strengthens me

59:59.583 --> 01:00:00.958
-Deep!
-Oh!

01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:03.666
Even though we're now freezing to death
On this plane

01:00:04.541 --> 01:00:06.708
I have Coco's warm feet here
And can't complain

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.666
But, Coco
Don't get used to this situation

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.041
We gotta get back to Uruguay
Our beloved nation

01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:15.666
-That's right!
-Come on, Coco. Go.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.583
Okay, but mine's kinda sentimental.

01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:21.500
On October thirteenth
My mother's birthday I did miss

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:23.583
So I humbly ask God

01:00:24.458 --> 01:00:26.083
To finally come home

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:28.541
So I can give her a big kiss

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.000
-Very sweet.
-Nice.

01:00:31.666 --> 01:00:33.666
There are some decent people
In this space

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:37.041
Yet some know not the candidates
For the presidential race

01:00:37.541 --> 01:00:39.666
They are a tremendous disgrace

01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:43.916
-That was awful!
-That's terrible!

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
-All right.
-Terrible. The worst.

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:47.375
At least I tried, you know?

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:49.250
You guys didn't do anything.

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:51.916
Here in the mountains
The situation's intense

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.708
It makes me wanna start running
Like a puma

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:58.208
But I will not leave this place

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:00.791
Without first hearing a rhyme
From the reserved Numa

01:01:04.833 --> 01:01:06.541
Uh…

01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:09.333
On, uh, this extremely freezing mountain

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.666
Where… not even a spider can walk

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:18.291
In the… in the fridge

01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:22.166
On the mountain of the frozen fridge

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:23.458
Forget it.

01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.625
Of the mountain… All right.

01:01:26.708 --> 01:01:27.875
Bravo! Good!

01:01:27.958 --> 01:01:28.958
Come on, Numa!

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:31.875
Bravo!

01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:35.750
Hey, I tried.

01:02:34.416 --> 01:02:35.416
Roy!

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:54.916
Roy!

01:02:56.666 --> 01:03:00.375
-Down there! Down there!
-Here! I'm here!

01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:03.250
Dig!

01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:07.416
Fito!

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:10.625
-Tintín!
-Hey!

01:03:10.708 --> 01:03:12.708
-Hold on!
-Hold on!

01:03:12.791 --> 01:03:15.833
Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on! We're getting you out!

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.166
-Coche, help.
-Get him out!

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.625
-Dig! Come on!
-Hold on!

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:23.958
Hold on!

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.625
Everyone, dig! Dig!

01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:33.250
Help! Help! Help!

01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:35.375
Hang in there, Numa!

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:39.916
Numa, I'll get you out!

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
No! Coco!

01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:52.833
-Over here!
-Coco!

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.250
Liliana's down there!
Don't step on her!

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:58.541
Watch out! Liliana's down there!
For God's sake!

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:01.416
Please, don't step on her!
Liliana's there!

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.041
Liliana, hold on! Don't step on her!
Liliana's down there! Please!

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:07.791
Don't step on her! Baby, I'll get you out!

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:08.875
She's here!

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.791
Coco! No!

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:13.791
-Coco! Coco! Coco! Coco!
-Help me!

01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:17.500
Coco!

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:21.083
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!

01:04:21.166 --> 01:04:23.250
Breathe, baby. Breathe.

01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:26.750
Breathe! Oh God!
Breathe, baby. Please.

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:29.250
Breathe. Oh, baby. Just breathe.

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.375
-He's not breathing!
-Breathe.

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:32.416
Hold on!

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.333
Please breathe.

01:04:34.416 --> 01:04:37.791
No, my love, don't go.

01:04:43.291 --> 01:04:44.458
What's that noise?

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:46.875
What's happening?
What's happening?

01:04:46.958 --> 01:04:47.958
What is that?

01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:14.750
Come on.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:18.791
-There's air.
-Oxygen's coming in.

01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:20.333
-There's air.
-Yes.

01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:23.666
Is everyone okay?

01:05:24.166 --> 01:05:26.625
-Arturo?
-I'm alive!

01:05:26.708 --> 01:05:28.750
Javier's alive. Liliana's gone.

01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:30.750
-Vasco?
-Right here. I'm alive.

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:33.666
-I'm alive too! It's Roberto.
-Yeah, I'm alive! It's Moncho.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:35.250
Pedro Algorta here.

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:37.375
Diego? Diego?

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:39.083
Diego's dead, Fito!

01:05:39.958 --> 01:05:41.666
He's gone. And Roque. Roque too.

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.875
Maspons couldn't make it.

01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:45.958
-It's Nando. I'm alive.
-Enrique and Juan Carlos are dead.

01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:47.500
-Tintín, you okay?
-I'm here.

01:05:47.583 --> 01:05:48.708
Coco?

01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:52.458
-Coco?
-Coco's dead. This is Roy.

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:55.583
-And Marcelo? Marcelo?
-Marcelo!

01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:57.125
-Marcelo!
-Marcelo!

01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:59.208
-Marcelo?
-Captain!

01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:00.541
Marcelo!

01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:12.083
Marcelo was buried.

01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:17.541
He stopped feeling cold
because he didn't feel anything.

01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:21.875
And to stop feeling here is a relief.

01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:28.125
For 17 days,
we've waited for a moment like that.

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:32.166
A moment of calm.

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:37.000
A second of quiet.

01:06:56.583 --> 01:07:00.291
-How much snow could we have on top?
-It could be the entire mountain.

01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:04.250
Everyone, pray! Right now!

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:06.750
"And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus."

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:10.125
Today is October 30th.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.625
Today is my birthday.

01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:15.916
I'm turning 25.

01:07:19.958 --> 01:07:22.250
Today it's hard
not to think of home.

01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:51.291
If light comes in,
we shouldn't be too deep in the snow.

01:08:21.458 --> 01:08:23.125
How long do you think we'll be here?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
We can't go out until the storm's over.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:49.958
DAY 18
TWO DAYS BURIED

01:08:55.833 --> 01:08:57.833
The hunger is unbearable.

01:09:01.833 --> 01:09:06.666
Till now, the Strauch cousins
have been able to make the meat just meat.

01:09:07.958 --> 01:09:09.416
Meat without a name.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.916
Without a face.

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.291
But that's impossible here.

01:09:19.958 --> 01:09:23.958
So what?
Are we gonna do nothing?

01:09:35.291 --> 01:09:36.333
Roberto.

01:09:43.125 --> 01:09:44.416
To survive, we gotta eat.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.708
Now you're letting yourselves die?

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:51.875
After all we've been through?

01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:56.541
We gotta get out. I'm not staying here!

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.333
We gotta get out!

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:04.833
What else do you want?

01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:06.208
Stop, Numa!

01:12:06.291 --> 01:12:07.291
Come on!

01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:09.208
Stop it, Numa!

01:12:11.083 --> 01:12:12.500
Numa!

01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:32.541
DAY 20
FOUR DAYS BURIED

01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:59.291
I see the sky!

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.791
Come on, Moncho. Go first. You're smaller.

01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:06.208
Go. Go, go, go.

01:13:23.041 --> 01:13:24.291
The sun!

01:13:26.041 --> 01:13:27.875
Help me! Come on!

01:13:53.958 --> 01:13:55.083
We made it.

01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:01.875
Hey! What do you see?

01:14:02.458 --> 01:14:04.208
Margarita's out here, Álvaro.

01:14:04.291 --> 01:14:06.666
-Your girlfriend!
-In a bikini!

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.958
Tell her I'll be right up!

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:12.208
-We're alive!
-We made it!

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:24.500
Hey! Come on!

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:46.208
The bottle. The bottle.

01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:00.166
How's the leg?

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:04.250
It's okay.
It's just a cut. I'll be fine.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.083
Save your energy, Numa.

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:08.833
'Cause I don't have any left.

01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:10.750
Don't say that, Arturo.

01:15:13.416 --> 01:15:14.291
Don't lose your faith.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.708
I have more faith
than I ever had in my whole life.

01:15:17.791 --> 01:15:21.041
What, are you an altar boy now?

01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:23.833
Don't laugh at me.

01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:32.416
'Cause my faith…

01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:35.416
Sorry, Numa.

01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:37.916
…isn't in your God.

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:42.625
Because that God

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:46.416
tells me what I'm supposed to do at home.

01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:51.166
But he doesn't tell me
what to do on the mountain.

01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:56.958
What's happening here
is a completely different situation.

01:15:59.125 --> 01:16:00.083
Numa.

01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:03.583
This is my heaven.

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:05.958
I believe in another god.

01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:09.458
I believe

01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:13.625
in the god that Roberto
keeps inside his head

01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:16.791
when he comes to heal each of my wounds.

01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:22.791
In the god that Nando keeps in his legs

01:16:24.625 --> 01:16:27.125
and that lets him continue walking
no matter what.

01:16:33.041 --> 01:16:34.916
I believe in Daniel's hands…

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.500
when he cuts the meat.

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.708
And Fito, when he gives it to us

01:16:44.583 --> 01:16:47.208
without saying which of our friends
it belonged to.

01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:50.125
That way, we can eat it without…

01:16:54.208 --> 01:16:56.166
without having to remember their faces.

01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:01.916
That's the god I believe in.

01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:06.291
I believe in Roberto.

01:17:07.958 --> 01:17:09.083
In Nando.

01:17:12.041 --> 01:17:13.041
In Daniel.

01:17:14.916 --> 01:17:16.208
In Fito.

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:21.250
And in our dead friends.

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:28.125
You're a philosopher, Arturo.

01:17:30.916 --> 01:17:32.416
Altar boy and philosopher.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:51.250
Okay.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.208
-Come on!
-We have to go now.

01:17:54.333 --> 01:17:56.666
-Look at the sun.
-We need to wait.

01:17:57.166 --> 01:17:59.791
-Wait for what?
-To be prepared.

01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:02.333
What if we get caught in a storm?

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:04.875
We need temperatures to rise.

01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:07.041
We can't spend a single night
out in the open.

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:08.958
Tell him, Numa.

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.583
The thaw starts on November 15th.

01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:14.041
There's a lower risk of storms
because temperatures rise.

01:18:14.125 --> 01:18:18.125
-Two weeks… just waiting.
-No. Two weeks of preparation.

01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:22.458
So far, we've always gone out
without a plan, and we've failed.

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:25.333
We don't even know
what kind of distance we're facing.

01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:27.041
Hey!

01:18:28.208 --> 01:18:29.666
We need help over here!

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:32.375
-Go grab those chairs!
-Come on. Dig

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:33.500
Come help.

01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:37.708
All good? Grab those plates.

01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:40.041
-Yeah? Let's go.
-Need help?

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:42.250
-How can I help?
-Dig on the other side.

01:18:55.666 --> 01:18:58.791
I don't get it.
I thought you didn't wanna die here.

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:09.583
DAY 34
THE THAW BEGINS

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:21.208
Help me, Roberto. Give me a hand.

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:23.625
Watch it. Hold his head, please.

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:27.000
Very slowly. Lift him. There you go.

01:19:27.083 --> 01:19:29.333
Slowly. Slowly. Slowly.

01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:32.541
Easy, easy, Arturo. That's it.

01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:35.333
Let's lift his shirt up slowly.
That's it.

01:19:43.875 --> 01:19:45.208
Arturo's really sick.

01:19:45.875 --> 01:19:48.916
He's got three days. Vasco, maybe five.

01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:50.500
What do you think?

01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:51.791
About what?

01:19:52.291 --> 01:19:54.958
-The days they have left.
-What do you want, Gustavo?

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:57.083
Say it.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.416
What is it?

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:05.125
Roberto, there's nothing more
we can do here as doctors.

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:09.291
We're gonna end up becoming gravediggers.

01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:13.208
Now, I know how hard it is.

01:20:14.166 --> 01:20:16.416
But you're the strongest player
on the team.

01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:19.666
Now you have to walk for everyone else.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.583
Pass it!

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:30.916
Roberto, pass it!

01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:34.125
Careful. Over there.

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:37.000
Move him.

01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:41.958
Let's put him here.

01:20:50.041 --> 01:20:53.166
I'm here. I'm here. Breathe, Arturo.
Breathe with me. Come on.

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.666
Arturo Nogueira's lungs
are filled with fluid.

01:20:57.791 --> 01:20:58.916
He can't hold on.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.875
There you go. There you go.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:05.541
-Gustavo tries to help.
-That's it. There you go. There you go.

01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:08.791
But no one can breathe for him.

01:21:08.875 --> 01:21:11.833
Good job. Good job.

01:21:15.958 --> 01:21:20.083
There you go. There you go.

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.208
We have to try everything.

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:12.750
Four of us volunteer.

01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:18.750
We head downhill towards Argentina.

01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:23.208
With warmer clothes…
in the hope of surviving a night outside.

01:22:23.291 --> 01:22:24.958
DAY 36
EXPEDITION EAST, ARGENTINA

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:02.666
Numa!

01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:13.250
Ow.

01:23:15.166 --> 01:23:17.625
Numa, you okay?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.500
It's infected.

01:23:32.916 --> 01:23:34.083
Let's go back.

01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:37.125
We can't carry him.

01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:42.750
-Roberto!
-I'm going back alone.

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:49.041
The plane's still close.

01:23:55.708 --> 01:23:56.875
Okay.

01:24:02.041 --> 01:24:03.083
Sorry.

01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:37.958
-What happened?
-Numa?

01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:39.125
Numa?

01:24:39.208 --> 01:24:41.166
Where are the others?

01:24:42.166 --> 01:24:43.958
Numa, answer me. Say something.

01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:45.833
It's okay. We're here.

01:24:45.916 --> 01:24:47.083
What happened?

01:24:53.375 --> 01:24:55.375
Where is he? My dad!

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:57.916
-No, Vasco. We're here.
-Dad?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.041
-Calm down. We're here.
-Where's Dad?

01:25:00.125 --> 01:25:03.291
Look at me.
Look at me. Your dad's here.

01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:06.583
Look at me. We're here. We're here.

01:25:11.416 --> 01:25:13.791
-Dad! Dad, come here!
-Stop.

01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:17.583
Calm down.

01:25:18.708 --> 01:25:19.958
We're here.

01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:22.666
Vasco.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.375
-Hey, Vasco! Look at me!
-Dad!

01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:32.291
Flight 328,
we are now boarding at gate ten.

01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:35.875
-Thanks.
-Rafael… Rafael Echevarren.

01:25:35.958 --> 01:25:37.375
Huh? Echavarren!

01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:06.291
I don't understand, Javier.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.541
From the very first moment
we crashed in this place,

01:26:09.625 --> 01:26:11.666
I've tried to help as much as I could.

01:26:13.666 --> 01:26:14.708
I tried…

01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:18.666
to always do the right thing, you know?

01:26:22.625 --> 01:26:24.750
And now, with my leg like this…

01:26:28.791 --> 01:26:30.083
I'm useless.

01:26:34.916 --> 01:26:36.500
What does it all mean?

01:26:37.416 --> 01:26:39.708
What's the meaning of the death of Arturo?

01:26:39.791 --> 01:26:43.375
The death of Vasco?
Or the death of everybody else?

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:53.916
Liliana gave everything. Always.

01:26:58.291 --> 01:27:01.166
During the avalanche,
while buried under the snow,

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:03.708
I could feel her body underneath mine.

01:27:08.208 --> 01:27:11.583
I remember there was only a few inches
between me and the surface.

01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:13.958
I could actually pull my head out, and…

01:27:14.041 --> 01:27:16.625
and shout at her
with all my strength I had.

01:27:16.708 --> 01:27:18.541
"Liliana, hold on!"

01:27:18.625 --> 01:27:20.541
"I'll get you out. I'm alive, love."

01:27:21.791 --> 01:27:23.583
I saw them stepping over where she was,

01:27:23.666 --> 01:27:27.208
and I shouted, "Oh, my God!
Don't step on her! Don't!"

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:30.083
"Don't step on her, please!
Liliana's trapped below."

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.666
But there was simply no way to get her out
if I didn't get out first.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.208
But I was unable to move because my feet
were pressed against her chest.

01:27:45.208 --> 01:27:49.166
And if I pushed against her,
it would make her sink deeper and deeper.

01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:57.291
What is the meaning of that, Numa?

01:28:02.041 --> 01:28:07.208
When we finally got to Liliana,
she was just a lifeless corpse.

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:10.541
At that moment,
as they kept digging up friends,

01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:13.666
one dead, one alive, one dead, one alive…

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:19.208
then… I hugged Liliana
with all my strength.

01:28:20.791 --> 01:28:24.041
And I felt a love
I'd never felt in my life.

01:28:31.291 --> 01:28:33.500
And I realized that I had a purpose,

01:28:35.291 --> 01:28:39.500
which was to take that love that
I was squeezing there against my chest…

01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:43.458
and bring it to my kids back home.

01:28:47.041 --> 01:28:48.916
Her death was not in vain.

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.750
That wound doesn't make you useless.

01:29:32.916 --> 01:29:34.541
Someone ripped
all the parts off.

01:29:35.833 --> 01:29:37.791
-Are you serious?
-Are you helping?

01:29:37.875 --> 01:29:39.166
Nando?

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:41.875
They told me you've got lazy.

01:29:42.375 --> 01:29:45.166
That you sleep all day. Why?

01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:48.666
-You need to train, Numa.
-Why are you here?

01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:51.041
You're not gonna believe this.

01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:55.458
We walked for about
two, three hours, towards the east.

01:29:57.291 --> 01:30:00.958
Until, suddenly,
behind a hill, we found the tail.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.208
I can't believe we found it.

01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:07.500
It… it catapulted itself forward.

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:10.250
To the other side.

01:30:11.125 --> 01:30:12.333
It was amazing.

01:30:12.833 --> 01:30:15.500
It was completely full
of scattered suitcases, clean coats.

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:18.000
We found bottles of rum.

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:20.750
Cigarettes.

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:25.916
And chocolate.

01:30:31.541 --> 01:30:33.916
Stop, stop, stop, stop. Not the wrapper.

01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:39.791
Now you're telling me
what to eat, man?

01:30:40.625 --> 01:30:41.625
There you go.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:43.583
Mm!

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.000
You were right, Numa.

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:55.666
We spent a night out in the open,
and we almost didn't make it.

01:30:58.958 --> 01:31:01.041
But we found the plane's batteries.

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:05.291
They were in the tail.

01:31:10.125 --> 01:31:12.250
It'll be much easier
to bring the radio here.

01:31:14.541 --> 01:31:16.458
Did you see Roy fixed the portable radio?

01:31:16.541 --> 01:31:19.458
And Roberto thinks he can get
that one in the plane to work too.

01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:23.083
We're going back down there.

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:25.333
We need to try.

01:31:50.125 --> 01:31:54.000
Nando, Roberto and Tintín leave
with Roy towards the tail of the plane.

01:31:58.666 --> 01:32:00.333
I wish I could go with them.

01:32:04.916 --> 01:32:07.666
Roy is weak and doesn't think
the radio will work.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.083
Come on, Roy. Not a lot of time.

01:32:10.666 --> 01:32:12.083
He's terrified.

01:32:13.625 --> 01:32:15.291
But he's doing it for the team.

01:32:24.833 --> 01:32:28.000
-I don't believe it.
-Nice, Roy.

01:32:37.208 --> 01:32:40.000
-1-C-6-0-1.
-Which one is it?

01:32:40.083 --> 01:32:42.541
B… Not this one. What was it?

01:32:42.625 --> 01:32:43.708
Uh…

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:46.000
-One, seven.
-Seven…

01:32:46.083 --> 01:32:47.166
What if it doesn't work?

01:32:48.416 --> 01:32:49.291
Huh?

01:32:49.791 --> 01:32:51.083
What do we do?

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:52.833
I guess we start walking back.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.458
Right, Roberto?

01:32:56.208 --> 01:32:58.250
Toward the west. To Chile.

01:33:02.416 --> 01:33:03.541
Hello?

01:33:05.583 --> 01:33:06.458
Hello?

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:10.708
We're the Uruguayans
who crash-landed in the Andes.

01:33:10.791 --> 01:33:13.333
Can you hear me? We're still here!

01:33:14.333 --> 01:33:15.333
Hello?

01:33:20.083 --> 01:33:20.916
Hello?

01:33:28.958 --> 01:33:31.083
Uh, I don't know. I never tried it.

01:33:36.416 --> 01:33:39.958
With every day that passes,
we lose more of our strength.

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:46.708
It's okay.

01:33:46.791 --> 01:33:50.625
The food rations aren't enough,
so we strip the bones of meat.

01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:56.375
What was once unthinkable
became routine.

01:33:56.458 --> 01:33:58.791
…number
of intercontinental ballistic missiles

01:33:58.875 --> 01:34:00.500
and other strategic offensive arms.

01:34:00.583 --> 01:34:02.333
We just stopped caring.

01:34:05.375 --> 01:34:06.250
Come on.

01:34:07.916 --> 01:34:09.416
Here. Eat a little.

01:34:11.875 --> 01:34:13.000
You have to eat, Numa.

01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:29.708
Half and half.

01:34:32.583 --> 01:34:33.625
You can't give up now.

01:34:34.416 --> 01:34:36.416
No, I'm not givin' up, Pancho.

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:38.750
You know, I'm dying.

01:34:46.333 --> 01:34:47.458
And it hurts me to not…

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:50.791
not be able to do more for you.

01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:52.250
Don't say that.

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:55.000
Think of yourself.

01:34:57.083 --> 01:34:58.750
You want me to think of myself?

01:35:02.416 --> 01:35:03.625
Look at me.

01:35:03.708 --> 01:35:05.958
I'm 25 years old, Pancho.

01:35:06.916 --> 01:35:10.333
I've got my enitre life ahead.
I've got everything left to do.

01:35:11.625 --> 01:35:15.250
I want to… see my siblings again.

01:35:15.333 --> 01:35:17.125
See my mother, my father.

01:35:17.916 --> 01:35:19.291
I want to dance.

01:35:19.375 --> 01:35:21.333
-Numa, you don't dance.
-I know.

01:35:23.041 --> 01:35:24.208
But now I want to.

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:27.083
I wanna do it all, Pancho.

01:35:29.291 --> 01:35:30.291
I want to laugh.

01:35:30.375 --> 01:35:33.000
-I want to cry.
-Then cry.

01:35:33.083 --> 01:35:34.541
-I can't.
-Cry.

01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:38.375
Do it. Come on, cry.

01:35:39.125 --> 01:35:40.166
Just cry with me.

01:35:41.083 --> 01:35:42.791
What's so funny?

01:35:44.458 --> 01:35:47.166
Cry with me. Come on. Let it go.

01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:53.125
Do it, moron.

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:56.083
Come on.

01:36:21.625 --> 01:36:22.833
Nando!

01:36:22.916 --> 01:36:23.958
Look at this.

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.750
-What's that?
-It's waterproof.

01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:33.708
We can use it, yeah?

01:36:34.916 --> 01:36:36.708
It was covering some pipes.

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:38.958
-Is there more?
-Yeah. There's a lot.

01:36:39.041 --> 01:36:41.750
Two, four… One, C.

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.500
No!

01:37:00.333 --> 01:37:07.083
AS OF TODAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1972,
THERE ARE 17 MORE SURVIVORS UP ABOVE

01:37:07.166 --> 01:37:11.166
IN THE URUGUAYAN PLANE
THAT CRASHED IN THE MOUNTAINS

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.041
What happened?

01:37:29.875 --> 01:37:31.250
The radio didn't work.

01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:34.458
But we found this fabric there.

01:37:35.208 --> 01:37:38.000
-What's this?
-It's waterproof.

01:37:39.125 --> 01:37:42.416
-We can make a vest.
-No. Not a vest, Tintín.

01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:43.791
Let's make a sleeping bag.

01:37:43.875 --> 01:37:47.750
With a sleeping bag, we could get
through the night. There's enough fabric.

01:37:49.291 --> 01:37:50.791
Or we could make a big one.

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:53.625
When are we leaving, Roberto?

01:38:00.791 --> 01:38:01.708
Roberto.

01:38:02.916 --> 01:38:03.916
When?

01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:08.208
As soon as the sleeping bag is done.

01:38:08.291 --> 01:38:10.375
58 days after the disappearance

01:38:10.458 --> 01:38:14.416
of the Fairchild 571 aircraft
from the Uruguayan Air Force

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:17.333
with 40 passengers and five crew members

01:38:17.416 --> 01:38:20.666
chartered to transport a rugby team
from the Old Christians Club

01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:22.958
and their companions to Chile.

01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:27.166
The local Air Force has specially equipped
a C-47 aircraft

01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:30.458
to resume the search
in the Andean Mountain Range.

01:38:31.708 --> 01:38:35.250
Come on, Roberto.
We can't go back to the beginning.

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:37.708
They said they'll look for us.

01:38:37.791 --> 01:38:41.291
Those morons who flew right over
and… and didn't see us?

01:38:41.375 --> 01:38:43.041
They're looking for bodies.

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:46.250
-We've been lost here for two months.
-Two months, Roberto.

01:38:46.333 --> 01:38:48.583
Do you still believe
they think we're alive?

01:38:48.666 --> 01:38:51.291
-Well, we are alive.
-Alive?

01:38:51.375 --> 01:38:54.416
Just look at us. Look at this.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.458
This isn't being alive.

01:38:56.541 --> 01:38:58.708
We won't make it
just by praying, you know.

01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.666
So you want to climb the mountain
sleeping in this?

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.041
What are you doing, Roberto?

01:39:10.625 --> 01:39:12.916
-Stop!
-Roberto.

01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:14.666
You didn't like it?

01:40:26.125 --> 01:40:27.125
Guys.

01:40:28.083 --> 01:40:29.625
I'm gonna take a picture.

01:40:48.416 --> 01:40:50.833
Tintín insists on taking pictures.

01:40:53.583 --> 01:40:57.375
Like he's capturing memories of a trip
that he's comin' back from.

01:41:00.166 --> 01:41:01.958
I wonder who these pictures are for.

01:41:03.916 --> 01:41:04.916
For us?

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.208
Smile, asshole.

01:41:07.291 --> 01:41:08.958
I'll never see them.

01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:10.666
Come on. We can still smile.

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.750
Maybe they're for our families.

01:41:15.833 --> 01:41:18.958
Or for other people
who are remembering us now,

01:41:19.041 --> 01:41:22.000
looking at pictures of us
that were taken in the past.

01:41:22.083 --> 01:41:23.500
Carlos. Look at me!

01:41:24.541 --> 01:41:29.291
And when they look at them,
we'll live again in their imaginations.

01:41:29.791 --> 01:41:33.791
Because they'll ask themselves
the same questions we're asking.

01:41:36.958 --> 01:41:39.291
"What happened to them?"

01:41:40.416 --> 01:41:43.000
What happened to us?

01:41:45.791 --> 01:41:47.666
Who were we on the mountain?

01:41:49.583 --> 01:41:50.583
Nando.

01:41:51.875 --> 01:41:56.875
I want you to know that
you have my permission to use my body.

01:41:59.333 --> 01:42:01.500
Stop fucking around. Don't say that.

01:42:03.833 --> 01:42:05.666
I'm know I'm not coming back.

01:42:09.583 --> 01:42:10.708
Don't say that.

01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:13.500
It's the truth.

01:42:18.125 --> 01:42:19.375
But it's all right.

01:42:20.333 --> 01:42:22.000
It's fine. I'm at peace.

01:42:27.541 --> 01:42:29.583
I'm prepared for what's coming.

01:42:31.666 --> 01:42:33.458
We both are, my brother.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:40.666
And I'm so happy
to know that you guys are gonna make it.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:46.875
That makes me feel very happy, Nando.

01:43:39.416 --> 01:43:40.583
Thank you.

01:43:58.458 --> 01:43:59.875
My name is Numa.

01:44:01.541 --> 01:44:04.833
I died on December 11, 1972.

01:44:06.666 --> 01:44:07.916
In my sleep.

01:45:15.875 --> 01:45:22.375
THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE
THAN TO GIVE ONE'S LIFE FOR FRIENDS

01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:25.666
We're leaving tomorrow.

01:45:38.791 --> 01:45:40.000
You got this.

01:45:40.875 --> 01:45:42.625
-Best of luck, Roberto.
-Thank you.

01:45:42.708 --> 01:45:43.708
-Take care.
-You too.

01:45:43.791 --> 01:45:44.916
Keep going.

01:45:45.875 --> 01:45:47.916
-No matter what.
-My friend.

01:45:48.541 --> 01:45:51.833
-Give me one more.
-Take care.

01:45:59.375 --> 01:46:00.583
Carlitos.

01:46:01.583 --> 01:46:02.541
Yeah?

01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:07.458
You can use the bodies
of my mom and Susy. Okay?

01:46:08.625 --> 01:46:09.708
Let's go!

01:46:09.791 --> 01:46:12.416
-Yeah, yeah!
-You can do it!

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.166
-You got this!
-Good luck!

01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:17.458
Come on, guys!
Look both ways before crossing

01:46:17.541 --> 01:46:19.416
and don't forget about us afterwards!

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:22.208
-We'll be waiting for you guys!
-We'll see you guys soon!

01:46:22.291 --> 01:46:24.666
-You can do it!
-Come on, guys!

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.125
DAY 61
EXPEDITION WEST, CHILE

01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:11.750
Nando!

01:47:11.833 --> 01:47:15.000
We have to find a ledge
to put the sleeping bag on!

01:47:16.291 --> 01:47:18.208
We have to climb a little more!

01:47:18.291 --> 01:47:20.458
We're not gonna make it up there!

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:29.708
I'll be in the middle.

01:50:01.583 --> 01:50:03.041
It's so beautiful.

01:50:10.541 --> 01:50:12.166
It's too bad we're dead.

01:50:15.291 --> 01:50:16.500
I'm not going back.

01:50:17.375 --> 01:50:21.916
The Andes have to end at some point
The snow too.

01:50:22.875 --> 01:50:24.750
The sea's right behind there.

01:50:26.250 --> 01:50:28.708
-This never ends.
-Look where we are, Roberto.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.416
After all we've climbed.

01:50:33.291 --> 01:50:34.750
We're so close now. Look.

01:50:36.291 --> 01:50:39.875
We just need to cross the valley.
How long can it take?

01:50:40.833 --> 01:50:42.166
Ten, twelve days?

01:50:44.416 --> 01:50:46.250
We only have enough food for a week.

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:48.958
What do you want to do?

01:50:49.791 --> 01:50:51.041
Come and walk with me…

01:50:53.166 --> 01:50:54.541
or wait on the plane?

01:50:57.833 --> 01:50:59.416
You're asking me to die with you.

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.375
I'm asking you to come with me.

01:51:02.916 --> 01:51:06.000
Look. Look over there.
See those two peaks?

01:51:06.083 --> 01:51:08.500
In the middle, like a pair of titties.

01:51:09.875 --> 01:51:11.250
There's no snow there.

01:51:12.791 --> 01:51:15.166
Can you see it? That's Chile.

01:51:17.583 --> 01:51:18.583
Can you see it?

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:30.750
I do.

01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:32.750
Thanks.

01:51:33.833 --> 01:51:35.000
Careful.

01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:44.083
Nando and Roberto went on,
heading west.

01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:49.333
We agreed I should come back
so the food would last longer.

01:51:52.833 --> 01:51:55.291
From above, you can actually see
some lower ridges.

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:57.458
Looks like they have
a sort of brownish color.

01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:02.000
Like there's no more snow there.

01:52:05.416 --> 01:52:07.750
The guys are healthy. Doing really great.

01:52:07.833 --> 01:52:09.916
They have enough food for like ten days.

01:52:10.916 --> 01:52:12.416
Nothing's gonna stop them.

01:53:42.708 --> 01:53:43.708
A valley.

01:55:46.416 --> 01:55:47.416
Roberto!

01:55:50.166 --> 01:55:51.166
Roberto!

01:55:52.416 --> 01:55:53.458
Nando!

01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:59.291
Hey! Hey!

01:55:59.375 --> 01:56:00.875
Hey! Help us, please!

01:56:01.625 --> 01:56:04.125
We're from a plane
that crashed in the mountains!

01:56:04.208 --> 01:56:07.333
-Hey! Hey!
-Help us! We're starving!

01:56:12.375 --> 01:56:15.000

I'M FROM A PLANE

01:56:26.875 --> 01:56:29.791
"I'm from a plane
that crashed in the mountains."

01:56:29.875 --> 01:56:30.875
"I'm Uruguayan."

01:56:33.625 --> 01:56:36.125
"We've been walking
through the snow for ten days."

01:56:36.208 --> 01:56:39.083
"There are 14 injured
and stranded people in the plane."

01:56:40.083 --> 01:56:42.916
"We need to get out of here fast,
and we don't know how."

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.125
Call from San Fernando.

01:56:44.208 --> 01:56:46.666
"We have no food."

01:56:47.166 --> 01:56:48.541
"We are very weak."

01:56:49.541 --> 01:56:52.250
-"When are you coming to get us?"
-"When are you coming to get us?"

01:56:52.333 --> 01:56:55.041
"Please. We can barely walk."

01:56:55.125 --> 01:56:56.125
"Where are we?"

01:57:01.250 --> 01:57:02.958
A call from San Fernando.

01:57:21.541 --> 01:57:22.666
Mm.

01:57:52.291 --> 01:57:54.208
-Come on.
-Camera ready?

01:57:54.291 --> 01:57:56.291
-Get ready.
-Let's talk to these guys.

01:58:31.125 --> 01:58:33.500
We interrupt this broadcast,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:58:33.583 --> 01:58:37.166
to bring you more information
on the news we gave you a few minutes ago.

01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:39.583
We now have the names
of the two young survivors

01:58:39.666 --> 01:58:43.833
from the Uruguayan plane that crashed
in the Andes 71 days ago.

01:58:43.916 --> 01:58:48.250
Their names are Roberto Canessa
and Fernando Parrado.

Lookin' good, huh?

01:59:45.583 --> 01:59:47.375
What should we do with all this?

02:00:40.708 --> 02:00:42.291
Okay, everyone.

02:00:42.375 --> 02:00:44.875
I'm going to tell you
the names of the boys.

02:00:44.958 --> 02:00:46.583
-Can you hear me?
-Loud and clear.

02:00:46.666 --> 02:00:48.916
Just repeat each

Each name twice.

There they are! There they are!

02:02:29.208 --> 02:02:30.791
It's all of them!

02:02:30.875 --> 02:02:32.541
All of them! Hey!

02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:03.166
-Come on! Let's go!
-Whoo!

02:03:03.250 --> 02:03:04.625
Let's go!

02:03:09.916 --> 02:03:11.583
We're going home!

02:03:25.625 --> 02:03:28.041
Come on, Roy! Get up, man!

02:03:33.583 --> 02:03:37.375
-Come on, Gustavo!
-Hey! Leave it! Leave it!

02:03:37.458 --> 02:03:40.166
-What do you mean?
-Put it down!

02:03:41.666 --> 02:03:43.166

02:03:54.458 --> 02:03:55.666
Come on!

02:04:54.125 --> 02:04:57.500
On December 22, 1972,

02:04:57.583 --> 02:05:01.375
16 survivors came back
from the Andean Mountain Range.

02:05:04.125 --> 02:05:06.083
Today my voice carries their words.

02:05:08.583 --> 02:05:10.958
How each of us played our part.

02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:16.708
This is our story.

02:05:24.083 --> 02:05:25.166
Mom!

02:05:34.708 --> 02:05:36.083
This is a miracle.

02:05:37.291 --> 02:05:39.833
-This is a miracle.
-What miracle, Ma?

02:05:39.916 --> 02:05:41.333
What miracle?

02:06:04.375 --> 02:06:06.833
The homecoming is overwhelming.

02:06:09.208 --> 02:06:10.958
What is this crowd doing here?

02:06:14.458 --> 02:06:19.041
They want to get close to my friends.
Touch them, know everything.

02:06:20.083 --> 02:06:21.958
"What happened on the mountain?"

02:06:25.458 --> 02:06:28.000
We made it! Thank you!

02:06:28.083 --> 02:06:29.458
Thank you!

02:06:29.541 --> 02:06:33.208
Journalists want to know,
with their cameras and microphones.

02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:41.541
Doctors want to know,
with their exams and instruments.

02:06:47.541 --> 02:06:49.166
What do they see?

02:06:55.625 --> 02:06:58.041
They're scared of their dirty clothes.

02:07:00.916 --> 02:07:03.666
Their skeletal bodies, baked by the sun.

02:07:09.291 --> 02:07:10.666
The grime on their skin.

02:07:37.541 --> 02:07:38.791
Nando!

02:07:40.958 --> 02:07:43.625
The newspapers talk
about the heroes of the Andes.

02:07:46.666 --> 02:07:50.291
The ones who came back from death
to reunite with their fathers…

02:07:53.583 --> 02:07:54.875
Their mothers.

02:07:55.458 --> 02:07:58.625
You look like an old man.

02:08:00.416 --> 02:08:03.041
Their girlfriends.

02:08:08.250 --> 02:08:10.666
And their children.

02:08:33.125 --> 02:08:35.291
But they don't feel like heroes.

02:08:38.041 --> 02:08:42.500
Because they were dead like us,
and only they got to come back home.

02:09:08.083 --> 02:09:09.958
Now when they remember us,

02:09:10.833 --> 02:09:14.291
they ask themselves,
"Why didn't we all get to come back?"

02:09:16.416 --> 02:09:17.875
"What does it all mean?"

02:09:22.916 --> 02:09:24.958
You'll need to find out yourselves.

02:09:29.083 --> 02:09:31.083
'Cause the answer is in you.

02:09:40.375 --> 02:09:42.375
Keep taking care of each other.

02:09:44.791 --> 02:09:47.541
And tell everyone
what we did on the mountain.
