SILVER AND THE BOOK OF DREAMS

00:36.541 --> 00:37.708
Where am I?

00:39.375 --> 00:40.416
What is this place?

00:44.625 --> 00:45.791
Dad?

01:07.958 --> 01:10.750
Dad!

01:11.875 --> 01:13.541
No, Dad!

01:34.500 --> 01:35.833
Help me!

01:37.375 --> 01:39.250
Wake up. We're in London.

01:43.583 --> 01:45.125
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.583
It's this way.

01:53.083 --> 01:53.916
Cool.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.083
Mom!

01:55.666 --> 01:57.041
You're finally here.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.500
Welcome to London. How were your holidays?

01:59.583 --> 02:01.541
-Butter!
-We went hiking everyday.

02:02.916 --> 02:03.750
Come on.

02:14.291 --> 02:16.375
You'll love Ernest.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.125
I have a surprise for you.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.458
It's going to be great.

02:21.458 --> 02:23.083
I hate her surprises.

02:34.291 --> 02:37.458
Hello, ladies. Welcome to London.

02:37.541 --> 02:38.708
This is Ernest.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.208
You must be Liv. It's lovely to meet you.

02:43.750 --> 02:44.708
You're very welcome.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.291
-And Mia, of course.
-Nice to meet you. Hi.

02:48.375 --> 02:50.958
Let's go inside
so you can meet the others.

02:51.666 --> 02:53.708
-Who are the others?
-No idea.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.375
-Come on, Butter.
-Where are we?

02:56.458 --> 02:57.833
Please no commune.

02:58.375 --> 03:00.375
We're so happy to have you join us.

03:01.208 --> 03:03.666
-Aren't we, Florence?
-Of course.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.375
Can I go upstairs now?

03:07.375 --> 03:10.125
A tenner until we finish eating and see?

03:11.125 --> 03:12.250
My soup bowl is empty.

03:12.333 --> 03:16.375
-You paid her?
-She's not exactly a people person.

03:17.166 --> 03:20.083
Florence, please stay.
Don't you want to get to know the girls?

03:20.166 --> 03:21.166
Unbelievable.

03:21.250 --> 03:22.291
Where's their father?

03:25.125 --> 03:26.625
Sorry, I should've seen this coming.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.500
No, it's fine.

03:31.375 --> 03:32.291
He died.

03:33.250 --> 03:36.125
Five years ago. He had an accident.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.583
-What kind?
-Florence, enough.

03:37.666 --> 03:38.500
Sorry I'm late.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.750
-Grayson.
-He's not sorry. Liar.

03:41.833 --> 03:42.666
Finally.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.333
Hey. I'm Grayson.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.500
Liv.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.250
I'm Mia. Nice to meet you.

03:50.333 --> 03:51.250
Hey.

03:52.125 --> 03:52.958
Cool.

03:53.583 --> 03:54.583
Enjoy your meal.

03:59.291 --> 04:02.041
So, you guys are gonna live here now?

04:02.125 --> 04:03.666
-Like a patchwork family.
-Yeah.

04:04.333 --> 04:06.291
Here's to new beginnings.

04:07.916 --> 04:09.875
Here's to replacing Dad.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.500
No one wants to replace your dad.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.250
But we all have the right to be happy.

04:16.332 --> 04:18.916
That's why you drag us
to a new country every year?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.500
I'm so sorry you know five languages.

04:21.582 --> 04:25.041
I'm sorry I'm not in the mood
to play the happy family with strangers.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.332
I give you a month.
He won't stand you any longer.

04:28.416 --> 04:29.291
Challenge accepted.

04:31.832 --> 04:32.707
I'm so sorry.

04:32.791 --> 04:34.791
-Florence, could you please show...
-No.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.166
-I'm sorry.
-I don't need anyone's help.

04:37.707 --> 04:38.666
I'm so sorry.

04:38.750 --> 04:39.582
It's fine.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.582
The bathroom is upstairs.

04:42.666 --> 04:45.332
Oh, no. It's all on the carpet.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.750
Don't let Butter lick it up.

05:16.832 --> 05:18.457
Anabel is gone for a reason.

05:18.541 --> 05:20.916
We don't know
if we can find another maiden.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.332
Wait.

05:22.416 --> 05:24.957
-That's my jumper.
-It's super nice.

05:27.750 --> 05:30.250
Okay. It's too dangerous.
Why have we played this game?

05:31.375 --> 05:34.457
Come on. No one is really a maiden.
Or Anabel wasn't a maiden.

05:35.582 --> 05:38.207
Okay, I'll give it one last try.
Then I'm out. Bye.

05:39.750 --> 05:40.832
I hate this shitty book.

05:41.791 --> 05:46.375
Today we're gonna bake
some special treats for Christmas.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.416
Lamingtons!

05:48.500 --> 05:50.875
Exactly, and I'm gonna show you
how it's done.

05:50.957 --> 05:51.875
Shall we give it a go?

05:51.957 --> 05:53.750
-Yeah. It's coconut.
-This is coconut.

05:53.832 --> 05:56.250
-Yeah.
-Sponges and you cut them in half,

05:56.332 --> 05:57.957
-and cut them into squares.
-Yes.

05:58.041 --> 06:00.750
-I've been dreaming about him a lot.
-Yeah?

06:04.250 --> 06:05.458
What do you dream about?

06:08.708 --> 06:10.791
The dreams are like this video.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.208
We're making Lamingtons.

06:12.958 --> 06:16.791
But then we're
in this really beautiful red house.

06:17.666 --> 06:19.375
Like a cottage, you know?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.457
-Am I there, too?
-Of course you are.

06:26.750 --> 06:30.000
You and Dad are making a huge mess,
like always.

06:33.332 --> 06:35.416
I really wish I could talk to him again.

06:37.707 --> 06:39.291
Just one more time.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.541
To tell him that I'm sorry.

06:46.332 --> 06:47.500
He knows.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.832
Here. You get Dad's watch tonight.

06:58.625 --> 06:59.832
Say hi to him from me.

07:00.666 --> 07:02.541
You can't say hi to people in dreams.

07:03.708 --> 07:04.916
You don't know for sure.

07:05.541 --> 07:06.875
I'll tell him you said hi.

07:34.916 --> 07:36.957
I'm going to get something to drink.

09:58.333 --> 09:59.375
Grayson.

10:27.166 --> 10:29.166
You're lucky Anabel's ancestors
didn't choose

10:29.250 --> 10:31.291
to get their ashes scattered
in the North Sea.

10:31.375 --> 10:37.000
-Bloody Highgate Cemetery, of all places.
-Besides, mate, it's not that creepy.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.583
It is. Look at that.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.540
-Hey, Henry. You saying, Gray?
-Hey, Jas.

10:43.625 --> 10:44.625
Hey, Arthie.

10:45.833 --> 10:47.000
Right, the Scott fam.

10:47.083 --> 10:50.750
Probably we should wait. Are you sure?
Like, everything looks exactly the same.

10:51.915 --> 10:54.875
-Okay, man. Chill.
-They all look creepy in the dark.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.958
It says we have to form a circle,

10:59.790 --> 11:01.208
and raise your arms.

11:02.666 --> 11:03.500
Come on, Gray.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.916
Okay, no, I can't. I feel stupid.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.708
-Just raise your arms, Gray.
-Please. We need to get this done, okay?

11:18.166 --> 11:21.333
Show us who will replace Anabel Scott
in time for Hallows' Eve.

11:21.875 --> 11:22.916
Show us...

11:24.666 --> 11:26.083
-What is that?
-Shit.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.958
Well, that's not very predictable.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.291
Who's that?

11:30.375 --> 11:31.208
Shit.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.665
-Who's that, Gray?
-It's a girl.

11:34.750 --> 11:35.583
Hi.

11:35.665 --> 11:38.500
-That's genius. No shit. Obviously.
-That's my new stepsister.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.250
This is really weird.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.833
That's your new stepsister?

11:41.915 --> 11:44.000
-Yeah, one of them.
-I wasn't following you.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.415
You should take a photo, it lasts longer.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.375
She seems cool.

11:57.958 --> 12:00.875
You seem... really weird.

12:02.041 --> 12:03.291
Do you fancy her?

12:03.375 --> 12:05.458
No. Me and her, we're almost like...

12:06.291 --> 12:07.333
related.

12:08.041 --> 12:10.750
Her mom is currently sleeping with my dad.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.333
Let me see that also.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.875
Why am I dreaming of her?

12:16.375 --> 12:18.833
-This is like my subconscious going...
-It's her.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.041
She's the chosen one.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.750
Chosen for what? Tell me.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.125
-No guys, she's not the chosen one.
-She is.

12:26.208 --> 12:29.208
-I can't lie. I'm a hundred percent sure.
-This is what we call...

12:29.291 --> 12:30.416
This is a coincidence.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.040
There are no coincidences, Grayson.
Besides, isn't she wearing your jumper?

12:34.125 --> 12:36.665
Guys. "She" is right here.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.665
Yeah, bro. Isn't that your jumper?

12:39.665 --> 12:42.625
Yeah, she took my jumper
from the bathroom, like-- Okay.

12:43.208 --> 12:44.708
Yeah, I think she's cute.

12:45.875 --> 12:46.750
Go away!

12:47.375 --> 12:49.125
-That's a bit harsh.
-Why?

12:49.208 --> 12:51.125
-She's not real.
-Maybe she is.

12:51.665 --> 12:52.790
Maybe she's a dreamer.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.583
-How do we explain why she's here?
-Shit.

12:54.665 --> 12:57.125
-A dreamer? What?
-Again?

12:57.208 --> 12:58.958
-What is happening?
-Oh, no.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.250
-Shit.
-We need to move.

13:00.333 --> 13:04.000
Your dream is turning into a nightmare.
Let's go back to the dream hall.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.666
-Guys, she's not the maiden.
-Where's your fucking door?

13:06.750 --> 13:08.250
What the hell is going on?

13:34.125 --> 13:35.833
-Hi.
-Morning.

13:36.665 --> 13:38.875
Wasn't there a green door here yesterday?

13:40.915 --> 13:42.165
No. Why?

13:42.708 --> 13:46.125
-Can you show Mia and Liv around school?
-How much?

13:46.750 --> 13:48.458
I'm not paying for everything now.

13:48.540 --> 13:52.040
Can we move back to Paris, then?
To live with our real mom instead of them?

13:53.458 --> 13:56.000
So no grand tour, then.
I'm not their tourist guide.

13:57.290 --> 14:00.125
-Grayson!
-I'm not going, I'm sick.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.083
You get Dad's watch today.

14:07.708 --> 14:10.458
-I hate the first day of school.
-I hate the last day.

14:20.083 --> 14:21.416
I think it's okay here.

14:25.708 --> 14:26.625
It'll be fine.

14:33.083 --> 14:35.540
Okay, whatever that was. Daisy?

14:36.500 --> 14:37.833
-Yeah?
-Take her.

14:37.915 --> 14:38.958
Take me where?

14:39.875 --> 14:40.915
To the dungeon.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.040
No, I'm just kidding.
I'll show you around.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.290
Okay, cool.

14:46.375 --> 14:47.208
Good luck.

14:47.290 --> 14:50.540
My name's Persephone Porter-Peregrin.
I'm the school president.

14:50.625 --> 14:51.750
Cool. Congrats.

14:51.833 --> 14:55.290
Well, you know what?
You can just call me Persy. Honestly--

14:55.790 --> 14:58.915
Sorry, mate. Vote for me again!

14:59.000 --> 15:00.416
Where do we want to start?

15:01.416 --> 15:04.333
School canteen or hallways? Or...

15:05.083 --> 15:09.416
Library! Library/make-out central,
let's go!

15:09.500 --> 15:12.041
I've done seven school tours
in five years.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.791
Can I just have my locker number?

15:15.875 --> 15:18.208
Sure, it's right here.

15:18.750 --> 15:19.958
And this is your key.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.416
It's cursed.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.250
Excuse me?

15:26.750 --> 15:29.000
The locker. It's cursed, they say.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.333
It belonged to Anabel Scott.

15:32.415 --> 15:34.290
-Anabel Scott?
-Yeah.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.583
-Weird.
-Why?

15:37.083 --> 15:40.290
I feel like I've heard that name before.

15:40.375 --> 15:41.500
Well, could be.

15:42.958 --> 15:44.040
That's her.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.083
Is she dead?

15:47.165 --> 15:49.208
No, she just vanished.

15:49.290 --> 15:52.500
Nobody knows where she is,
not even her best friends.

15:52.583 --> 15:55.583
Arthur, Jasper, Henry,
who you're gonna love.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.500
-She's right there.
-If you're into boys.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.583
-It's her.
-Are you?

16:01.041 --> 16:02.416
This can't be.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.083
Hey, where are you going?

16:09.291 --> 16:10.500
Jasper, check there.

16:19.541 --> 16:21.083
-She's gone.
-Jesus.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.708
-Are you sure it was her?
-She can't be too far.

16:23.791 --> 16:25.375
Let's just go to Gray's later.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.791
That's a shot. We'll find her again.

16:28.250 --> 16:29.750
I know you fucked up.

16:33.958 --> 16:37.583
Have you ever had a dream about someone,
then seen them in real life?

16:38.958 --> 16:41.290
-You have a crush. Oh, my God...
-No.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.833
-I knew it.
-No, I don't.

16:42.915 --> 16:45.250
Okay, chill. I'm just saying.

16:45.833 --> 16:50.165
But if you did dream of someone
and then met them in real life...

16:51.290 --> 16:54.083
-... they're the person of your dreams.
-Highgate Cemetery.

16:54.165 --> 16:56.500
-You haven't processed it yet...
-See you later!

16:57.750 --> 17:00.208
Liv, what are you doing?
That's the wrong bus!

17:28.208 --> 17:29.875
It's the one from my dream.

17:39.416 --> 17:40.708
Scott family...

17:43.375 --> 17:44.750
This is all from my dream.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.166
That's impossible.

17:50.708 --> 17:51.541
DREAMS FEEL REAL

18:09.666 --> 18:10.791
Lucid dreaming.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.958
It's the ability to know
you're dreaming while you're dreaming

18:14.041 --> 18:16.041
and gain control over your dreams.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.083
Step one, perform a reality test.

18:19.041 --> 18:21.125
Look at your hand. Does it look different?

18:21.208 --> 18:23.833
Can you count your fingers
and has anything changed?

18:23.916 --> 18:28.041
If it has, you might be dreaming.
But this is an obvious example.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.916
If you delve deeper,
there's a lot more to it.

18:33.166 --> 18:37.000
One, two, three, four, five.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.166
One, two, three, four, five.

18:43.416 --> 18:46.666
Should we ambush her like that?
All of us? I don't know. It feels weird.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.708
She's the chosen one.

18:47.791 --> 18:49.750
-She's your chosen one.
-What?

18:50.416 --> 18:51.791
He wants to talk to her alone.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.000
Who else you trying to be
at the graveyard?

18:54.083 --> 18:55.791
It was actually subtle...

18:55.875 --> 18:56.875
Shut up.

18:57.333 --> 18:58.333
Shit.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.083
-What are you doing?
-Invite her.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.000
No.

19:02.083 --> 19:05.958
-Grayson, we're running out of time.
-I don't want Liv to be involved in this.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.041
Hi...

19:09.833 --> 19:12.958
My mate, Arthur, is having
a Halloween party this weekend.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.250
Yep. Everyone's gonna be there.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.416
Wow. Except me.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.750
Why not? Can't be as scary
as the graveyard.

19:21.833 --> 19:22.916
What graveyard?

19:24.750 --> 19:26.458
The one where you buried Anabel?

19:27.208 --> 19:29.833
Please, we didn't bury her.

19:29.916 --> 19:32.333
We chopped her up
and fed her to the seagulls.

19:33.583 --> 19:38.125
Oh, my God, Arthur, this is...
He's kidding.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.625
Well, I don't have a costume, so...

19:40.708 --> 19:42.416
I think Grayson's jumper suits you.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.875
Yeah, I kind of want my jumper back.

19:45.958 --> 19:47.208
It's very cozy.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.166
Yeah, which is why I want it back.

19:51.666 --> 19:53.041
All right, in a bit then.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.958
-That wasn't so hard, was it?
-She didn't say she was coming.

19:56.791 --> 19:59.458
Come on, Henry.
She's not gonna invite us in the yard.

19:59.541 --> 20:00.541
Weirdo.

20:01.708 --> 20:02.791
You're idiots.

20:31.916 --> 20:35.333
If you can't count your fingers,
it's a dream.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.500
So, this one doesn't open?

22:04.208 --> 22:05.375
Butter.

22:08.625 --> 22:09.500
Dad?

22:11.666 --> 22:13.666
Mia, you really are dreaming of him.

22:15.041 --> 22:16.333
You won't get in there.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.250
You're Anabel.

22:21.791 --> 22:23.083
Guilty as charged.

22:24.625 --> 22:26.083
I didn't want to go in there.

22:26.625 --> 22:27.875
Of course, you didn't.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.958
It's private.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.208
If what you want is behind that door,

22:34.416 --> 22:38.375
all you have to do is go to Arthur's party
and you will see your dad again.

22:50.333 --> 22:51.166
Butter.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.125
I need a costume.

23:02.625 --> 23:05.208
You're not a fan
of wearing your own clothes, are you?

23:05.291 --> 23:07.291
I look great, don't you think?

23:07.791 --> 23:13.333
Yeah. This was my graduation outfit
from when I was in primary school.

23:14.791 --> 23:18.083
-And you're giving it back this time.
-Wow. Is this Arthur's house?

23:18.166 --> 23:20.625
Yeah, Arthur has money.

23:26.125 --> 23:28.791
Hey, you cut your hair!

23:28.875 --> 23:31.291
I shaved it.

23:31.375 --> 23:35.666
-I'll get drinks. Don't talk to the boys.
-Okay, yes, sir. Brother.

23:39.416 --> 23:40.708
Ahoy, sailor.

23:41.625 --> 23:43.791
Ahoy, Henry.

23:44.291 --> 23:45.875
-You look great.
-Thanks.

23:46.416 --> 23:48.750
You look like a psychopath.

23:50.041 --> 23:53.833
Thank you. I didn't know it was Halloween,
it was just really good timing.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.083
Yeah? Where's the chainsaw?

23:56.708 --> 24:00.000
I left it in my last victim.

24:02.791 --> 24:03.958
Where was this?

24:05.000 --> 24:08.458
That's Anabel's grandma's house in Spain.

24:09.541 --> 24:11.416
We went there last spring.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.541
Is that where she is now?

24:14.625 --> 24:16.750
I honestly don't know.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.041
-Liv!
-Arthur.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.416
Glad you could make it.

24:23.458 --> 24:27.125
-So, are you ready?
-Sure. Ready for what?

24:28.750 --> 24:30.208
Come on. We won't murder you.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.666
What the fuck is this?

24:39.750 --> 24:42.500
-It's medicinal. For my migraines.
-Yeah?

24:42.583 --> 24:44.791
-Yeah.
-Try drinking some water for a change.

24:44.875 --> 24:45.916
What the fuck?

24:46.833 --> 24:50.375
-Sorry about that. Cousin issues.
-I hate you. Where did it all go?

24:50.458 --> 24:51.958
Persephone's your cousin?

24:52.500 --> 24:53.958
She's basically his sister.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.666
Okay, I'll be back.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.208
-Nice. Are we a band now, or something?
-You wish.

25:02.708 --> 25:05.291
This is my parents' studio,
so don't touch anything.

25:11.125 --> 25:13.833
-You ever heard of The Book of Dreams?
-No.

25:13.916 --> 25:15.916
Hey, open the door.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.541
He's gonna be pissed.

25:17.625 --> 25:19.791
-You guys are assholes.
-Love you too.

25:19.875 --> 25:23.916
I said I don't want Liv
to get involved in this.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.583
Maybe I don't want to be involved
in this little boys' club.

25:30.625 --> 25:32.458
Okay, that's great. Let's go home, then.

25:32.541 --> 25:36.666
No! She's already a part of this.
She's a natural dreamer.

25:36.750 --> 25:37.708
Okay, how?

25:39.458 --> 25:40.791
How is this even possible?

25:41.500 --> 25:44.041
-I don't know.
-There isn't a copy of the book, is there?

25:44.125 --> 25:45.000
Don't think so.

25:45.083 --> 25:50.208
Last midsummer's eve,
Anabel showed us The Book of Dreams.

25:51.916 --> 25:55.250
-It's been in her family for generations.
-All right, can I see?

25:56.916 --> 26:00.750
To unleash its magic,
four men and a maiden...

26:00.833 --> 26:03.375
-A "maiden"? Really?
-It's not like virgin.

26:03.458 --> 26:04.916
It's what the book wants.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.166
-It's a pretty sexist book.
-It is.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.291
Four men and a maiden
must complete the games.

26:12.583 --> 26:14.375
Rituals, if you will.

26:14.916 --> 26:17.416
We've already completed
the first initiation ritual.

26:18.958 --> 26:19.916
We became dreamers.

26:21.291 --> 26:22.291
We...

26:23.291 --> 26:25.458
are able to go into other people's dreams.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.250
Now Anabel's gone, we need a new maiden.

26:31.041 --> 26:32.291
Why is she gone?

26:34.708 --> 26:36.750
-She's ghosting us.
-Of course.

26:36.833 --> 26:38.375
-She dumped him.
-Shut up.

26:38.458 --> 26:39.458
You shut up. I'm just--

26:39.541 --> 26:41.208
-Okay.
-Don't tell her everything.

26:41.291 --> 26:46.083
"When Hallows' Eve is due,
make your greatest wish come true."

26:46.166 --> 26:47.875
Are you serious? Is this a joke?

26:48.416 --> 26:50.666
Come on, guys. Did you write this?

26:51.166 --> 26:52.625
Yeah, that's just stupid.

26:53.583 --> 26:54.875
Is this a joke?

26:56.375 --> 27:00.333
Look, we don't know how you can do it,
or if you were just playing a game.

27:01.250 --> 27:05.416
Like Jas said, you're a natural dreamer.
So, might just as well make it official.

27:07.583 --> 27:10.250
So, what do you think?

27:11.291 --> 27:14.041
Liv, you really don't have to.

27:14.125 --> 27:16.458
She's old enough to make her own decision.

27:17.583 --> 27:20.208
So, what do you say then, Silver? You in?

27:21.833 --> 27:23.958
All right, bring it on.

27:26.583 --> 27:28.791
You promised you wouldn't murder me.

27:28.875 --> 27:31.541
Relax. We just need
a teeny-tiny drop of blood.

27:37.583 --> 27:38.916
Okay.

27:39.708 --> 27:42.416
I hate blood. Makes me sick.

27:42.500 --> 27:45.791
-Well, don't faint on us again, okay?
-What? I never fainted.

27:55.791 --> 27:58.083
Okay. The ritual states

27:58.666 --> 28:02.333
we need to write our dreams
on a piece of paper and burn it.

28:03.791 --> 28:07.166
-What's the catch?
-Bro, there is no catch.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.458
There's always a catch.

28:09.916 --> 28:11.500
-Pass me the pen.
-Please.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.583
Jasper's first.

28:20.416 --> 28:22.833
Okay. Cheers.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.375
What I really wish for,

28:31.250 --> 28:33.541
is to become
a professional basketball player.

28:33.625 --> 28:35.291
-Nice.
-Surprise, surprise.

28:35.375 --> 28:36.833
You already are a champion, Jazzy.

28:36.916 --> 28:37.833
Grayson.

28:39.541 --> 28:41.000
I wish...

28:43.541 --> 28:46.333
to be school president.

28:46.416 --> 28:47.708
That's a nice wish.

28:47.791 --> 28:50.125
-Gray for president?
-Well, good luck with that.

28:52.750 --> 28:54.750
I wish to be together with Anabel again.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.000
That's sad, bro.

29:01.166 --> 29:02.458
Henry, you're next.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.000
I wish...

29:08.166 --> 29:09.291
None of your business.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.750
Bro, are you serious?

29:11.916 --> 29:13.000
Liv?

29:18.458 --> 29:19.416
Liv?

29:25.500 --> 29:26.625
I wish...

29:34.166 --> 29:36.041
I wish I could talk to my dad again.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.041
There you are.

30:23.750 --> 30:25.583
I'll see you in your dream.

30:54.750 --> 30:55.750
Damn it.

31:23.166 --> 31:28.750
Please welcome to the stage
our new school president, Grayson!

31:33.625 --> 31:35.458
Thank you!

31:38.416 --> 31:39.750
Thank you!

31:41.000 --> 31:45.708
-I wanna say, this is not about winning...
-Of course this is what he dreams about.

31:46.250 --> 31:50.916
This is about fighting for your dreams.
You just made it fucking real!

31:51.708 --> 31:55.875
Thank you! I love you!

32:03.041 --> 32:05.166
This is hard-core, man.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.708
This is so going viral.

32:13.166 --> 32:14.666
I'm sorry.

32:15.208 --> 32:16.250
Liv!

32:16.958 --> 32:18.791
-Come with me.
-I'm sorry.

32:20.458 --> 32:22.791
Come on.
Hurry up before this all turns to shit.

32:24.791 --> 32:26.750
-That was so weird.
-Well, that was close.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.583
So, what the hell is this place, actually?

32:35.666 --> 32:38.208
Oh, yeah. We call this a dream hall.

32:39.541 --> 32:42.583
It's where all dreams connect.
Everyone has their own door.

32:43.291 --> 32:48.833
But we can only enter if we wear something
belonging to the person dreaming, right?

32:49.625 --> 32:51.750
Yes, we call them anchors.

32:53.250 --> 32:58.625
Anchors? Why anchors? Why not keys?
'Cause they unlock the door, right?

33:00.583 --> 33:03.250
-Shut up, you smart-ass.
-Okay, who's dream is this?

33:05.166 --> 33:06.583
Maybe you're dreaming of me.

33:07.125 --> 33:09.000
Or you're dreaming of me.

33:13.833 --> 33:17.625
-Wake up! Liv, wake up!
-What?

33:19.208 --> 33:22.583
-Liv, wake up! Wake up!
-What?

33:22.666 --> 33:24.666
-Liv, you can't do that.
-Do what?

33:24.750 --> 33:27.708
-Dreams are private, okay?
-Okay.

33:27.791 --> 33:30.583
To be a part of this,
you have to respect some rules.

33:30.666 --> 33:32.875
Well, no one told me about any rules.

33:32.958 --> 33:34.458
I'm telling you now, so listen.

33:35.416 --> 33:39.583
Rule number one is no snooping around
in your friends' dreams.

33:39.666 --> 33:42.458
-Don't do that again.
-Okay.

33:42.541 --> 33:43.750
Take it off.

33:43.833 --> 33:45.833
-What?
-Take my stuff off of you!

33:46.375 --> 33:47.375
Okay.

33:48.541 --> 33:49.958
Don't touch my stuff.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.083
All right.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.041
You okay?

34:06.625 --> 34:07.875
Haven't you heard?

34:08.416 --> 34:09.250
No.

34:21.333 --> 34:22.583
When was this?

34:23.208 --> 34:24.583
An hour ago.

34:26.416 --> 34:28.958
He broke his arm. Season's over for him.

34:29.041 --> 34:30.291
Maybe even his career.

34:30.375 --> 34:33.166
What a nightmare. Vote for me!

34:38.875 --> 34:40.541
Tonight, I'm getting into your dream.

35:08.458 --> 35:11.916
Hi, Henry. Fancy seeing you here.

35:13.916 --> 35:14.916
This?

35:15.666 --> 35:19.541
Yeah, I... Thanks. I always sleep in...

35:21.666 --> 35:24.833
In day wear, like a crazy person.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.208
Okay. Shut up and go to sleep.

35:50.791 --> 35:53.333
Mia, where are you?

35:56.291 --> 35:57.958
Snooping around again?

35:58.041 --> 35:59.583
Did you dress up just for this?

36:00.708 --> 36:04.166
No. Did you?

36:05.125 --> 36:06.916
-What? This?
-Yeah.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.041
No, I didn't.

36:09.208 --> 36:11.250
-Let me show you something.
-Okay.

36:15.541 --> 36:18.291
Be the little girl when I'm asleep.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.500
This is your dream?

36:21.583 --> 36:22.958
Yeah. What gave it away?

36:23.875 --> 36:25.500
No, it's my sister, Amy's.

36:26.791 --> 36:30.041
-She looks like you.
-This tap water tastes delicious.

36:30.541 --> 36:32.833
It's hot chocolate, silly.

36:32.916 --> 36:34.791
-Are we allowed hot chocolate?
-Yes.

36:34.875 --> 36:37.375
Just don't tell the witch.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.041
-I promise.
-Who's the popsicle stick? Your dad?

36:45.541 --> 36:47.416
No, that's me.

36:48.708 --> 36:52.708
I made him for her, but...

36:53.458 --> 36:58.875
Bow ties are not my style,
but Amy wanted me to look smart. So...

37:00.541 --> 37:01.500
What?

37:02.791 --> 37:05.166
-You're cute.
-So are you.

37:19.166 --> 37:23.250
Which one of you stupid kids
left their damn Lego lying around?

37:23.333 --> 37:25.083
-It's turning into a nightmare.
-What?

37:26.666 --> 37:28.250
-Where's the door?
-Oh, shit.

37:30.083 --> 37:32.750
-There's another way to get out.
-Okay, what is it?

37:33.708 --> 37:35.583
Turn. Like dancing.

37:40.375 --> 37:43.958
When you turn slowly
in a dream, new location.

37:44.541 --> 37:47.375
-Okay, cool. What now?
-Now we're gonna jump.

37:47.458 --> 37:48.541
What?

37:50.458 --> 37:52.958
No. Are you joking? It's too high.

37:53.041 --> 37:54.916
You don't wanna know, but you'll find out.

37:55.000 --> 37:55.875
No way. No.

37:55.958 --> 37:59.833
Jumping is just a way out of a dream.
You wake up before you hit the ground.

38:00.666 --> 38:02.166
I'm not doing it.

38:02.250 --> 38:04.041
You want to stay here with my crazy mom?

38:05.250 --> 38:07.583
Don't you dare!

38:19.458 --> 38:22.166
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

38:22.250 --> 38:23.708
Why are you counting?

38:25.416 --> 38:27.500
And why the hell are you wearing shoes?

38:29.833 --> 38:30.708
Cold feet?

38:31.416 --> 38:34.125
This is too much for me right now.
Good night, Liv.

38:34.916 --> 38:36.875
Everyone is completely insane here.

38:39.958 --> 38:42.250
Blood moon event in two days.
Yeah, in two days.

38:48.333 --> 38:49.916
-See you later.
-Later.

38:50.958 --> 38:52.041
Your boy?

38:55.916 --> 38:57.791
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:58.291 --> 39:01.416
So, about last night...

39:02.541 --> 39:03.458
Nothing happened.

39:06.083 --> 39:07.791
What do you mean, nothing happened?

39:09.375 --> 39:11.708
We jumped from a ginormous doll house,

39:11.791 --> 39:14.166
nearly got stuck in your sister's dream...

39:14.250 --> 39:16.500
It's fine, Liv. Okay? Just leave it, yeah?

39:16.583 --> 39:19.250
So, for my election party tonight,
I was thinking

39:19.333 --> 39:22.291
you, me, and a couple of other people
at my favorite spot.

39:22.916 --> 39:26.041
I know, I'll put you on the list.
But first, wish me luck, okay?

39:26.125 --> 39:26.958
What for?

39:27.458 --> 39:30.500
School president election.
It starts in, like, ten minutes.

39:30.583 --> 39:31.583
Good luck.

39:32.125 --> 39:34.250
-Have any of your wishes come true?
-No.

39:34.750 --> 39:35.708
Relax, mate.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.958
You don't need magic to beat Persy.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.500
Take it easy.

39:42.416 --> 39:43.583
How do I look?

39:44.666 --> 39:46.208
Like a substitute teacher.

39:47.166 --> 39:49.333
That is not true. Look at me.

39:49.416 --> 39:51.291
He reminds me of Mrs. Middles. Remember?

39:53.541 --> 39:55.541
You look stunning.

39:55.625 --> 39:59.541
I'm sure you're all dying to get back
to class, so we'll make this quick.

39:59.625 --> 40:01.375
The votes have been counted.

40:02.250 --> 40:03.375
And the winner...

40:04.541 --> 40:05.708
is Grayson.

40:10.333 --> 40:12.416
Come up, say a few words, Grayson.

40:18.041 --> 40:22.291
Thank you, guys. I just wanna say
that this is not about winning.

40:23.083 --> 40:27.416
This is about fighting for your dreams
and never giving up.

40:28.416 --> 40:31.583
And we've all been dreaming together
for a long time

40:31.666 --> 40:34.041
and you just made it real,
so thank you so much.

40:34.125 --> 40:35.166
Thank you.

40:38.666 --> 40:40.250
Thank you! I love you.

40:40.833 --> 40:43.083
We love you, Grayson.

40:46.166 --> 40:47.000
No.

40:51.333 --> 40:53.791
Who the fuck did that?
What the fuck was that?

40:55.541 --> 40:57.083
Stop.

40:57.166 --> 40:59.916
What the fuck?

41:00.000 --> 41:02.583
Fuck me, that's bad, bro.

41:02.666 --> 41:04.625
That's literally my worst nightmare.

41:04.708 --> 41:07.833
No way! No way that just happened.

41:07.916 --> 41:09.500
But your dream came true.

41:09.583 --> 41:11.750
I mean, she's not wrong. You did win.

41:11.833 --> 41:13.208
Oh, my God!

41:16.166 --> 41:17.416
What the fuck?

41:18.208 --> 41:19.708
What the fuck?

41:20.375 --> 41:25.166
I've fully broken my hand.
And my career is done up, like--

41:25.250 --> 41:26.875
This is like my worst nightmare.

41:27.750 --> 41:29.416
Thank you to everyone. Peace.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.083
-No, I'm sleeping.
-Grayson?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.375
Why do you knock, then?

41:39.750 --> 41:41.000
Sorry, bad new habit.

41:41.791 --> 41:46.583
Okay, so Jasper's nightmare coming true
was very unlikely, right?

41:48.916 --> 41:53.583
The chances of your nightmare coming true
were like, what? One in a million?

41:54.458 --> 41:57.250
-One in a billion?
-What are you trying to say?

41:57.333 --> 42:00.041
Grayson, I have a terrible feeling
about this.

42:00.750 --> 42:02.375
Why? What do you mean?

42:02.458 --> 42:04.041
We need to look at the book again.

42:04.125 --> 42:05.750
We might find something out.

42:07.416 --> 42:08.791
This better be good.

42:13.750 --> 42:16.166
-Bro, what's this about?
-Something about the book.

42:16.250 --> 42:18.125
-What are you looking for?
-The catch.

42:18.916 --> 42:20.416
The book didn't say anything.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.708
Well, it does now.

42:25.791 --> 42:26.958
-Wait, what?
-What?

42:27.041 --> 42:28.958
-Look.
-That wasn't there before...

42:29.041 --> 42:30.125
I know, look.

42:30.208 --> 42:32.375
"Your pure devotion will suffice.

42:32.458 --> 42:34.625
"You will see
when you have closed your eyes."

42:34.708 --> 42:35.750
"Closed your eyes."

42:35.833 --> 42:37.875
We only see the catch when we're dreaming.

42:37.958 --> 42:43.458
"All of your dreams shall soon be true
but your nightmares will be, too,

42:44.125 --> 42:46.041
"as all of you must pay a price."

42:46.583 --> 42:47.875
I hate this book.

42:47.958 --> 42:50.791
-What if it's listening?
-I don't think it's gonna hear me.

42:50.875 --> 42:52.791
It can make things appear,
I'm not so sure.

42:52.875 --> 42:54.666
Five people, five nightmares.

42:54.750 --> 42:56.291
-Yours has come true.
-Yes.

42:56.375 --> 42:59.208
-Yours, as well.
-Yeah, almost forgot about that.

42:59.291 --> 43:01.541
It's after midnight,
so it could be any one of us.

43:01.625 --> 43:03.916
Jasper burned his paper first.

43:04.875 --> 43:06.291
Grayson went second.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.625
-Following that pattern, who's next?
-Me.

43:10.958 --> 43:11.833
It's me.

43:13.541 --> 43:15.041
What is your worst nightmare?

43:18.958 --> 43:19.791
Okay...

43:22.833 --> 43:25.416
Mine's drowning under ice.

43:26.250 --> 43:27.083
Shit.

43:27.166 --> 43:29.833
-Jesus.
-Well, that's a fucked up nightmare.

43:29.916 --> 43:34.833
-And you?
-Mine's losing all my teeth.

43:36.041 --> 43:37.416
-Bullshit.
-Yeah, right.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.625
Literally everyone has that nightmare.

43:39.708 --> 43:42.000
Guys, look at Persephone's door.

43:43.500 --> 43:44.333
No!

43:44.416 --> 43:46.666
-What's this?
-I think it's dissolving.

43:48.166 --> 43:49.416
Has this happened before?

43:49.500 --> 43:51.333
-No!
-Have you seen this happen before?

43:51.416 --> 43:52.333
It's happening.

43:52.875 --> 43:54.875
-What is this?
-Arthur, what's happening?

43:55.750 --> 43:57.166
Arthur!

43:57.250 --> 43:59.666
-I got Persephone hooked on drugs.
-What?

43:59.750 --> 44:03.166
My worst nightmare is
that she ODs and dies.

44:03.708 --> 44:04.916
-Shit!
-Well, fuck.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.375
I'm sorry, I couldn't...

44:06.458 --> 44:08.875
-No, no, no!
-Persephone's door.

44:08.958 --> 44:10.083
What do we do now?

44:10.166 --> 44:12.416
We have to find her. Like, now.

44:12.500 --> 44:13.916
I think I know where she is.

44:21.583 --> 44:22.541
Persephone!

44:23.750 --> 44:24.750
Persephone!

44:26.125 --> 44:27.250
Persephone!

44:28.250 --> 44:30.791
-Persephone!
-She's not interested in you, mate.

44:30.875 --> 44:31.833
Fuck off!

44:32.666 --> 44:33.500
Okay.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.125
Persephone!

44:43.250 --> 44:45.708
Hey, Persephone!

44:45.791 --> 44:46.958
Hey!

44:47.958 --> 44:51.500
She's not... She's not breathing!

44:52.041 --> 44:53.458
Call an ambulance, now!

44:54.000 --> 44:55.083
Persephone!

45:14.375 --> 45:16.666
Liv? Are you all right? What's happened?

45:16.750 --> 45:19.666
She's dead in the toilet.

45:20.375 --> 45:21.291
Liv!

45:44.541 --> 45:46.333
Yeah, she died of an overdose.

46:11.208 --> 46:12.541
What?

46:13.041 --> 46:14.125
"Liv Silver."

46:17.375 --> 46:19.000
You look like death warmed up.

46:19.916 --> 46:21.375
I might be, soon.

46:21.458 --> 46:23.416
Speaking of which, I read about your dad.

46:24.333 --> 46:28.666
He smashed through the ice five years ago.
I wonder what killed him first.

46:29.333 --> 46:30.416
The cold?

46:31.416 --> 46:34.625
Or the lack of oxygen?
Were you with him that day?

46:36.833 --> 46:39.166
What? I'm curious, that's all.

46:39.250 --> 46:42.416
-You're sick.
-I don't have an issue with you.

46:42.916 --> 46:46.583
Come, Butter. Good girl. Liv?

46:47.166 --> 46:49.625
Where were you all night?
I was worried about you.

46:50.333 --> 46:51.208
Yes, Butter.

46:53.875 --> 46:55.500
Something came for you.

46:57.583 --> 46:58.958
Have you been crying?

47:00.250 --> 47:01.375
Liv, what's going on?

47:04.000 --> 47:05.791
Persephone from school is dead.

47:05.875 --> 47:07.041
What?

47:08.125 --> 47:11.666
I just feel like it's all my fault. Again.

47:11.750 --> 47:13.750
No. Come here.

47:14.250 --> 47:15.708
It wasn't your fault.

47:16.708 --> 47:19.500
Everything is fine. It's going to be okay.

47:23.666 --> 47:27.500
I know right now
the pain feels unimaginable.

47:28.416 --> 47:32.375
Persephone always inspired us
with her enthusiasm.

47:32.458 --> 47:33.916
-Her ability...
-This can't be.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.208
...to always keep going.

47:36.375 --> 47:38.458
There must be a way to stop this.

47:38.541 --> 47:44.291
In the coming weeks and months,
love each other. Support each other.

47:44.791 --> 47:47.375
And day by day, it will get easier.

47:48.833 --> 47:52.083
Okay, like--
Will this help us get, I don't know...

47:52.708 --> 47:54.500
-Who's this?
-Can't peel a chicken, Jas.

47:54.583 --> 47:58.416
-Is it technically black magic?
-Something about taking bath salts, but...

47:59.125 --> 48:02.375
Like sage bundle,
use a feather or wave or...

48:02.458 --> 48:04.583
"Get rid of negative energy,
negative entities,

48:04.666 --> 48:07.708
-"evil spirits and its harmful effects..."
-Yeah, that's...

48:08.291 --> 48:10.291
Smoke won't help us break this curse.

48:10.375 --> 48:13.750
-We should get an exorcist.
-Guys, there's something missing here.

48:13.833 --> 48:15.125
In the book?

48:15.208 --> 48:16.208
Yeah.

48:17.333 --> 48:19.666
Look, there's obviously a page missing.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.041
Here. "For your nightmares to reverse,
there are two ways to lift the curse."

48:26.125 --> 48:29.125
-And this is gone. Who would do that?
-Who the fuck did that?

48:29.208 --> 48:30.250
-Anabel.
-What?

48:30.333 --> 48:31.583
-She's alive?
-Of course.

48:31.666 --> 48:32.791
Do you know where she is?

48:32.875 --> 48:36.791
Anabel spent so much time in her dreams,
she loved it more than real life.

48:36.875 --> 48:38.458
Okay, and? So?

48:38.541 --> 48:41.541
She didn't know what was real
and what was a dream anymore.

48:41.625 --> 48:44.208
-What's the point?
-She tried jumping off a bridge.

48:44.291 --> 48:45.375
Why would she do that?

48:45.458 --> 48:48.541
-She thought she was waking up.
-Why are you telling this now?

48:48.625 --> 48:50.666
-Thankfully, she failed.
-Yeah, thankfully.

48:50.750 --> 48:53.708
-Jesus.
-She's recovering in a mental institution.

48:53.791 --> 48:55.458
Great. So, where is she?

48:55.541 --> 48:57.750
-Which hospital?
-I promised I wouldn't tell.

48:57.833 --> 48:59.000
Not even us?

48:59.791 --> 49:02.416
Are you proud
of your little shitty secret?

49:06.125 --> 49:07.416
I told you it was a bad idea.

49:07.500 --> 49:12.500
If you know where Anabel is, and she knows
where that page is, we need to get it.

49:12.583 --> 49:14.625
It's the only way
we can clear up this mess...

49:14.708 --> 49:17.583
We won't do shit, Liv. I'll do it.

49:17.666 --> 49:19.583
-We're coming with you.
-No, you're not!

49:19.666 --> 49:23.666
-We obviously can't trust you.
-I know Anabel better than anyone.

49:23.750 --> 49:26.875
-She doesn't know you, won't talk to you.
-You'd be surprised.

49:28.083 --> 49:29.375
What's that supposed to mean?

49:29.458 --> 49:30.291
Nothing.

49:30.958 --> 49:32.416
Go. What are you waiting for?

49:32.500 --> 49:34.750
They have visiting hours. I'll go then.

49:34.833 --> 49:36.916
Yeah. Great.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.625
Let's just sit around and waste time.

49:39.708 --> 49:42.875
Do you understand
that if we don't do this, I die?

49:43.958 --> 49:45.916
I'm not fucking stupid. Of course I know.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Do you even want to reverse the curse?

49:48.500 --> 49:49.708
Are you serious?

49:50.750 --> 49:52.041
My cousin is dead, you...

49:52.125 --> 49:54.375
-Hey, watch it!
-Why, is she your girlfriend?

49:54.458 --> 49:57.916
-It's not her fault your cousin did drugs.
-Are you fucking mad?

49:58.000 --> 49:59.291
-Say that again!
-Stop it!

49:59.375 --> 50:02.458
-Maybe if you knew how to breathe...
-I'm sorry!

50:02.541 --> 50:04.125
Don't touch me!

50:04.208 --> 50:05.708
I'm visiting from Germany,

50:05.791 --> 50:09.583
and I wanted to know
if Anabel Scott is in your hospital?

50:09.666 --> 50:13.375
-Sorry, that's confidential information.
-I understand.

50:15.625 --> 50:19.666
So, I really want to see her.
Is there any possibility I can come visit?

50:19.750 --> 50:22.541
I'm really sorry, miss.
You'll have to come back.

50:25.458 --> 50:27.875
So... If I only come
for like, two minutes,

50:27.958 --> 50:33.291
I swear, just two minutes and that's it,
I'll leave after two minutes. I promise.

50:33.375 --> 50:35.458
I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.

50:39.125 --> 50:42.833
"Wear this tonight
if you want to know more. A."

50:43.916 --> 50:44.750
Anabel.

50:54.750 --> 50:55.583
Hey!

50:57.041 --> 50:57.875
Need a lift?

51:00.041 --> 51:02.125
No, thanks. I want to be alone.

51:03.291 --> 51:04.666
What if I don't?

51:06.375 --> 51:07.541
It's my night, Liv.

51:08.458 --> 51:09.708
Okay. So what?

51:10.541 --> 51:13.125
Your worst nightmare
is literally losing your teeth.

51:13.208 --> 51:14.875
Make an appointment at the dentist.

51:16.708 --> 51:17.666
I lied.

51:21.916 --> 51:22.875
Please.

51:24.083 --> 51:26.208
Come with me and I'll tell you the truth.

51:30.708 --> 51:31.625
Okay.

51:35.250 --> 51:36.500
Get on.

51:36.583 --> 51:38.125
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

52:03.166 --> 52:04.166
This is it.

52:17.375 --> 52:20.416
-My gran is asleep upstairs.
-Okay.

52:32.541 --> 52:33.666
The dollhouse.

52:34.666 --> 52:35.750
That's mad.

52:42.375 --> 52:43.583
That's crazy.

52:56.166 --> 52:57.666
That's you?

52:58.666 --> 52:59.541
That's me.

53:04.208 --> 53:05.333
She's so sweet.

53:07.875 --> 53:09.500
Is that... her?

53:10.291 --> 53:11.166
Yeah, it is.

53:13.125 --> 53:14.208
My mom.

53:16.083 --> 53:17.375
Amy's witch. Yeah.

53:19.708 --> 53:22.000
My nan has custody over Amy.

53:25.208 --> 53:28.333
She takes better care of her
than my mom ever could.

53:32.500 --> 53:33.625
I love her...

53:35.125 --> 53:37.125
when she's sober, but...

53:38.458 --> 53:40.500
When she's not she...

53:41.916 --> 53:43.833
Her hurting Amy is...

53:45.750 --> 53:47.916
is a total nightmare.

53:51.750 --> 53:54.541
My worst, to be exact.

53:56.041 --> 53:59.291
So that's why
I have to protect her tonight.

54:03.416 --> 54:04.750
I hate my mom.

54:06.083 --> 54:07.083
Sometimes.

54:08.875 --> 54:10.166
That was actually...

54:13.291 --> 54:16.458
the last thing I said to my dad
before he died.

54:18.541 --> 54:19.583
I'm sorry.

54:21.208 --> 54:23.666
I started a stupid fight with my dad.

54:27.916 --> 54:29.708
I ran out on to the lake.

54:31.708 --> 54:34.791
And I remember hearing the ice cracking.

54:37.000 --> 54:43.000
And then it was suddenly dark
and I couldn't feel my body anymore.

54:46.375 --> 54:49.875
I was trapped under the ice.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.416
And then my dad's hand grabbed me
and pulled me out.

55:02.250 --> 55:04.541
Then, I heard the ice cracking again.

55:09.875 --> 55:12.000
And suddenly my dad was gone.

55:14.083 --> 55:17.583
It's not your fault.

55:20.291 --> 55:21.958
How would you have known?

55:24.833 --> 55:26.291
Hey. Liv.

55:41.916 --> 55:44.750
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm just checking if it's real.

56:06.125 --> 56:06.958
Liv.

56:13.291 --> 56:14.125
Liv.

56:24.916 --> 56:25.750
Liv.

56:29.500 --> 56:30.666
Come closer.

56:33.875 --> 56:35.083
Take the hand.

56:37.291 --> 56:38.291
Take it!

57:16.708 --> 57:17.833
Not what you expected?

57:21.541 --> 57:23.208
I don't blame you. I hate this dream.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.708
And you can't change it?

57:27.291 --> 57:29.458
I can't. They drugged me.

57:32.750 --> 57:35.708
Well, thanks for the invite, I guess.

57:37.083 --> 57:39.500
Did Arthur talk to you
about the missing page?

57:40.333 --> 57:42.166
Arthur knows where that page is.

57:43.416 --> 57:45.125
We read about the catch.

57:46.041 --> 57:48.375
We read about the nightmares
in the dream hall.

57:48.958 --> 57:51.541
I tried to talk him out of it,
but he wouldn't listen.

57:51.625 --> 57:54.375
He tore out that page
so I didn't see how to reverse it.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.041
Wow.

57:58.291 --> 57:59.208
Yes.

58:01.791 --> 58:06.000
He made it look like I'd lost
sense of reality. No one believed me.

58:07.208 --> 58:09.708
They say
I'm a psychologically fragile girl.

58:09.791 --> 58:11.250
Or should I say, "maiden"?

58:12.250 --> 58:14.791
I know, right? Super sexist.

58:16.083 --> 58:18.750
It actually means innocent blood,
not virgin.

58:19.250 --> 58:20.916
Arthur knew about the nightmares.

58:22.458 --> 58:24.666
He knew what would happen to Persephone.

58:24.750 --> 58:26.458
And he did it anyways.

58:27.083 --> 58:28.000
Yes.

58:30.083 --> 58:31.541
But why would he do that?

58:32.083 --> 58:33.833
I don't know. You have to find out.

58:34.500 --> 58:35.583
He'll never tell me.

58:36.958 --> 58:38.000
Not consciously.

58:38.833 --> 58:39.958
You mean...

58:41.458 --> 58:44.250
Quick, you're waking up.
Find the page and don't tell anyone.

58:46.166 --> 58:48.041
We don't know
who might be on it with Arthur.

58:48.125 --> 58:48.958
Hello?

58:49.041 --> 58:50.041
Check Arthur's boat.

58:50.125 --> 58:51.041
Liv?

58:53.500 --> 58:54.666
Mom. Hey!

58:55.208 --> 58:56.125
I told you!

58:56.208 --> 58:58.166
-For my sake...
-Get away from her!

58:58.250 --> 59:00.500
-Get that bitch out of my house!
-Fuck off!

59:01.625 --> 59:02.625
Are you all right?

59:03.333 --> 59:04.166
Amy?

59:06.291 --> 59:07.750
No, no, no. Amy!

59:10.541 --> 59:11.375
Amy!

59:14.750 --> 59:17.041
-I have to call the police.
-No!

59:17.125 --> 59:18.625
-What?
-Anabel said...

59:18.708 --> 59:19.625
Anabel?

59:19.708 --> 59:22.333
-Are you seriously talking about her now?
-Yeah.

59:22.416 --> 59:25.791
My sister is gone!
Anabel is a mentler, okay?

59:25.875 --> 59:28.833
-That's why she's in Winterhouse Hospital.
-Winterhouse?

59:28.916 --> 59:31.833
-What?
-How long have you known that for?

59:31.916 --> 59:35.625
Arthur told me. He wasn't supposed
to tell anyone. It's none of our business.

59:35.708 --> 59:36.875
Okay.

59:38.375 --> 59:40.625
-Well, what else do you know?
-What?

59:40.708 --> 59:42.333
Are you two planning something?

59:44.208 --> 59:45.916
You're starting to sound crazy, Liv.

59:46.416 --> 59:49.708
-Like Anabel, or what?
-I can't deal with this right now.

59:49.791 --> 59:52.250
If you're not going to help me,
then piss off.

59:52.333 --> 59:54.583
I thought we were supposed
to help each other.

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:16.416
Hey, Grayson...

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:20.625
Henry's nightmare came true.

01:00:22.291 --> 01:00:24.375
The real one, not the one with the teeth.

01:00:25.583 --> 01:00:27.416
So, I'm the only one left.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:31.000
Do you have an anchor to Arthur's dreams?

01:00:32.375 --> 01:00:35.583
Can you bring it to school?
I'll explain later.

01:00:44.125 --> 01:00:45.708
Hey, Liv. Are you coming today?

01:00:45.791 --> 01:00:48.708
The whole school will be there.
We're having a public viewing.

01:00:48.791 --> 01:00:50.625
I mean, the moon's turning red.

01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:52.250
I know.

01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:57.958
I don't know if I'll make it.

01:00:58.041 --> 01:00:59.500
Come on, it will be fun.

01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:02.583
Is everything okay, Liv?

01:01:03.833 --> 01:01:06.208
Liv, I told you, I'm not doing that.

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:08.166
You don't go into your friends' dream

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:11.291
-without them knowing...
-If we tell him, our cover is blown.

01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:12.791
Get out of here!

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:14.458
Fuck off!

01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:17.875
-What a dickhead.
-Guys, allow it, man.

01:01:17.958 --> 01:01:20.500
Arthur said Anabel
doesn't know anything about the page.

01:01:20.583 --> 01:01:22.000
Of course he said that.

01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:26.416
Arthur is my friend.
And I really like you,

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.416
but we've known you for, like, five days.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:33.500
So, can you please just tell us
what this is about?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.083
'Cause I don't know if I can
fully trust you guys.

01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:46.041
It gets like that. You see that, Grayson?
It gets like that. Okay.

01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:49.500
We want to help you.
We just need to know what you're up to.

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:54.083
-Okay, well, I don't need you.
-What?

01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:56.583
-I don't need anyone.
-Where are you going?

01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:57.541
Wait--

01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:03.541
Make sure you keep your goggles
on at the Bunsen burners, please.

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:10.583
Can you tie your hair back, please?
Thank you.

01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:12.041
How's it going?

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:13.958
What are you doing here, Silver?

01:02:14.041 --> 01:02:15.458
Have you found anything out?

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:17.875
She refused to see me.

01:02:46.416 --> 01:02:49.375
-You're starting to get on my nerves!
-I'm sorry.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.291
For fuck's sake.

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:03.958
Okay.

01:03:06.041 --> 01:03:07.625
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:03:28.791 --> 01:03:29.916
Okay.

01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:34.750
Yes!

01:04:04.458 --> 01:04:05.458
Where are you?

01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:17.291
"Sacrifice of the maiden.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:21.708
"On the blood moon night,
when everyone has paid their price,

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.041
"you'll make the final sacrifice.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:27.958
"Kill the maiden in dream's core
and be a dreamer evermore.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.416
"But if the maiden turns around,
destroys the book on dreamer's ground,

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:40.791
"the doors shall close and end the curse
and all the nightmares be reversed."

01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:41.708
Liv!

01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:45.958
Liv! The fuck do you think you're doing?

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:49.500
Liv, come back here!

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.708
Fucking bitch!

01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:04.833
Fuck!

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.500
Open, open, open!

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:18.041
Arthur wants to sacrifice the maiden
on the blood moon night,

01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:21.250
so that he can enter anyone's dream,
all over the world, forever.

01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:24.041
That's insane. We can't let him succeed.

01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:27.250
He won't. Not if the maiden
destroys the book first.

01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:28.708
I'll wake up and I'll get it.

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:31.583
But we don't know which maiden it is,
me or you.

01:05:32.916 --> 01:05:35.000
-You're right.
-We have to do it together.

01:05:35.083 --> 01:05:35.916
Liv!

01:05:36.458 --> 01:05:37.333
Liv!

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.750
Wake up! Liv!

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:42.083
Wake up, Liv!

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:47.041
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-Are you real?

01:05:49.166 --> 01:05:50.916
You're a fucking joke.

01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:57.791
Hey, please just text her...

01:05:57.875 --> 01:05:59.333
-Grayson!
-What?

01:05:59.416 --> 01:06:01.583
-Okay, this might sound crazy.
-What?

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:03.875
I read the missing page in Arthur's dream.

01:06:03.958 --> 01:06:05.333
How did you get in his dream?

01:06:05.416 --> 01:06:06.458
Listen. Hear me out.

01:06:06.541 --> 01:06:09.291
-What?
-This is me trusting you right now, okay?

01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:10.666
Okay.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:14.291
If the maiden destroys the book
on the blood moon, which is tonight,

01:06:15.541 --> 01:06:17.041
then all the curses get reversed.

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:18.416
Okay, that's a good thing.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.833
-Yes.
-Okay, all we need is the book.

01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:25.208
-Of course, you just have it already.
-Yep, and I need your car.

01:06:26.208 --> 01:06:28.666
-You don't know how to drive.
-That's why I need you.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:29.791
Let's go. Come on.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:38.291
Okay, so just let me get this straight.

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:43.500
-We get her out of the mental hospital...
-Correct.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:47.041
...so the maidens can destroy the book
and reverse all the nightmares.

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:48.208
-Yeah.
-That's the plan?

01:06:48.291 --> 01:06:51.250
-In a nutshell.
-Got it.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.250
-Can you drive any faster?
-No, I can't.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.458
-Keep the engine running.
-What? No...

01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:12.041
Liv, I'm coming with you!

01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:15.125
Okay, fine. I'll just stay here then.

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:22.416
Excuse me, miss. Can I help you?

01:07:23.041 --> 01:07:24.791
Visiting hours are done for today.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:28.500
Yes, I'm actually
the new doctor from Berlin.

01:07:30.583 --> 01:07:33.416
-What was your name?
-Dr. Franka Stein.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.166
Frankenstein?

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:38.291
And I suppose you are here
to see... Dracula?

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:44.208
Miss, this is a hospital for sick people.
I'm gonna need you to leave.

01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:45.541
Fine.

01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:48.166
I need to get one of your patients out.

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.166
Otherwise, I'll be sacrificed
in a sick blood ritual tonight

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.500
and my worst nightmare will come true.

01:07:53.583 --> 01:07:56.416
Okay, let me get you a doctor.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.666
Please, take a seat over there.

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.750
-Thank you.
-No problem.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:11.333
Anabel, Anabel, Anabel...

01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:38.457
-I found you.
-Oh, my God.

01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:41.500
You're my hero.

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:42.625
We need to be quick.

01:08:43.416 --> 01:08:44.957
Show me the book.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.625
-Drink something.
-Thanks.

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:53.332
Come on.

01:09:04.332 --> 01:09:05.916
Shit. What are they doing here?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.207
She figured it all out.

01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:08.957
I told you, you can't trust them.

01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:13.500
-If she escapes, and Anabel, it's over.
-I do know that.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.166
We need to get out of here.

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:17.166
Let's take the back door.

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:27.416
Let's try Arthur's car.

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:37.541
He left the key.

01:09:37.625 --> 01:09:40.082
-Now he'll definitely kill us both.
-Maybe.

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:43.791
Liv!

01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:44.707
Liv!

01:09:44.791 --> 01:09:45.832
Go!

01:10:03.958 --> 01:10:05.166
Anabel?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:07.958
Anabel!

01:10:14.666 --> 01:10:15.916
Oh, my God! Grayson!

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.208
Stop the car.

01:10:18.291 --> 01:10:20.375
Anabel, slow down. You're gonna kill us.

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:23.250
Not us, just you.

01:10:23.333 --> 01:10:24.708
What?

01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:26.875
You have to die tonight. I'm sorry.

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:31.666
Is this a dream?

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:33.708
It's your dream, to be exact.

01:10:35.625 --> 01:10:38.083
-When did I fall asleep?
-Quite a while ago.

01:10:38.583 --> 01:10:40.625
I drugged you when you came to my room.

01:10:40.708 --> 01:10:43.083
The water! You're an asshole!

01:10:43.166 --> 01:10:44.416
Please mind your language.

01:10:44.916 --> 01:10:47.958
-You hid the page in Arthur's dream...
-Took you a while.

01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:50.416
All I had to do was vanish

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
so the boys would start looking
for another maiden to replace me.

01:10:55.875 --> 01:10:58.666
If you crash the car
you're going to die as well.

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:00.916
No. You replaced me as maiden.

01:11:03.208 --> 01:11:04.666
I'm just gonna wake up.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.875
You know what? You're fucking insane.

01:11:20.041 --> 01:11:22.291
No. Where is it?

01:11:22.375 --> 01:11:23.833
What are you doing, Liv?

01:11:23.916 --> 01:11:26.833
You'll die tonight, anyway,
awake or asleep.

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:28.791
It's your nightmare, remember?

01:11:31.916 --> 01:11:33.375
I'll happily watch you die.

01:11:33.458 --> 01:11:35.875
I know the rules. If I jump in a dream,

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.541
I wake up before I hit the ground,
so I'm not gonna die.

01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:40.250
Yes, but you're the maiden.

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:43.625
How can you be so sure
you won't die on this special night?

01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:56.583
You're bluffing.

01:11:56.666 --> 01:12:00.208
If you really don't want me to jump,
then it's the right thing to do.

01:12:00.291 --> 01:12:01.666
You're forgetting something.

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:06.791
My anchor is not going to help you much
when I'm awake.

01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:08.791
It doesn't only belong to you.

01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:13.708
If you don't step down from there,

01:12:13.791 --> 01:12:17.625
I'll have to torture your sweet sister
in her dreams until she dies.

01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:21.041
You want this?

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.041
Okay, I'll come down.

01:12:34.541 --> 01:12:35.916
-Help!
-Liv!

01:12:37.375 --> 01:12:39.208
-Grayson! I'm here.
-What happened?

01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:40.500
She drugged me.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.458
Hey! Oh, God.

01:12:43.541 --> 01:12:44.625
Oh, my God.

01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:47.041
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:48.750
Okay.

01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:53.416
Anabel said she was gonna go
into Mia's dream. We need to find her.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.041
-I'll text the others.
-Okay.

01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:58.291
Wait, why is it snowing?
It never snows this time of the year.

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.083
It's my nightmare coming true.

01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:06.416
It begins. The moon is turning red.

01:13:09.583 --> 01:13:10.458
Come.

01:13:12.666 --> 01:13:15.083
-It's gonna be fine.
-I'll call the others.

01:13:26.541 --> 01:13:28.166
-Holy shit!
-Are you okay?

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:32.083
-You look like shit, but you're alive.
-Yeah, thanks, I'm working on it.

01:13:32.166 --> 01:13:34.250
-Come on.
-This is a really special night.

01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:36.958
A total lunar eclipse
is a rare phenomenon.

01:13:37.041 --> 01:13:39.208
-It only lasts for a few minutes.
-Mia!

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:43.416
-Have you seen Mia?
-She went upstairs to the rooftop.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:45.125
Wait, she was alone?

01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:47.833
No. There was someone with her.

01:13:47.916 --> 01:13:49.458
Anabel. Okay, let's go.

01:13:49.541 --> 01:13:50.958
Is this Mia's bag?

01:13:51.041 --> 01:13:53.416
-Yeah, she said she needed help...
-Thank you.

01:13:54.833 --> 01:13:56.708
-Anabel!
-Mia!

01:13:56.791 --> 01:13:58.208
-Mia!
-Mia!

01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:00.583
-She's not here.
-They can't be too far.

01:14:00.666 --> 01:14:03.458
-I'll wake her up from within.
-They're here somewhere.

01:14:03.541 --> 01:14:04.583
You gotta knock me out.

01:14:04.666 --> 01:14:06.625
It's too dangerous. Anabel is a nutjob.

01:14:07.583 --> 01:14:09.041
I have Mia's anchor.

01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:10.791
It's the only way.

01:14:11.958 --> 01:14:15.208
It'll be all right. But just in case, I...

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.500
I really like you.

01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:21.333
I like you, too.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.333
Now, knock me out.

01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:25.833
I mean it.

01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:27.333
I'm not just gonna hit you...

01:14:45.666 --> 01:14:47.500
Mia.

01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:51.041
Mia, where are you?

01:14:56.166 --> 01:14:57.708
Mia, where's your door?

01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:01.208
Where's your door?

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:04.625
Mia!

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:08.166
Mia!

01:15:09.125 --> 01:15:10.083
Mia!

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:37.833
-More cream or more marmalade?
-Jam time. Let's do it.

01:15:37.916 --> 01:15:40.541
Really, really... a lot we have to do.

01:15:40.625 --> 01:15:43.166
-A lot.
-Excellent.

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.125
We don't have to put marmalade on it.
It's good.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.541
Hey, Liv.

01:15:50.833 --> 01:15:52.083
Hi, darling.

01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:54.541
Are you still mad at me, Liv?

01:15:56.958 --> 01:15:58.000
No.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.541
Not at all.

01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:05.583
Good. Well then...
Come on, get back to work.

01:16:14.791 --> 01:16:15.833
Dad?

01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:17.666
Yeah, what's up?

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:22.541
I'm sorry.

01:16:25.041 --> 01:16:26.583
Liv, it's all right.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.166
It's all right.

01:16:33.125 --> 01:16:35.083
Every family fights now and then.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.458
Okay?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.625
It's a sign that we care.

01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:46.791
Liv.

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:47.958
I love you.

01:16:48.458 --> 01:16:49.625
I love you, Dad.

01:16:52.416 --> 01:16:53.583
I know.

01:16:57.208 --> 01:16:58.500
Come on.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.583
Now, get back to work.

01:17:03.833 --> 01:17:04.708
Liv?

01:17:05.791 --> 01:17:06.875
I'm cold.

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:09.291
I am so very cold.

01:17:11.875 --> 01:17:12.708
Mia!

01:17:14.083 --> 01:17:17.500
Mia. Mia, wake up!

01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:20.833
She can't. I drugged her.

01:17:21.458 --> 01:17:23.000
That's why her dream is freezing.

01:17:23.083 --> 01:17:24.041
You'll be fine.

01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:26.500
It's always sunny in your dreams.

01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:28.083
Please, Anabel. Stop this.

01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:29.208
You'll be fine.

01:17:29.291 --> 01:17:30.875
You have to die for me, first.

01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:39.375
I'll see you on the ice.

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:49.708
Bye, Dad.

01:19:32.375 --> 01:19:37.125
If I sacrifice myself,
will you destroy the book and let Mia go?

01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:41.541
I suppose as soon as the maiden
is sacrificed, I don't need the book.

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:44.500
It's a deal.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.875
In another life we could've been friends.

01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:53.708
But it had to be one of us.

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:56.375
It's nothing personal.

01:20:09.625 --> 01:20:10.625
Neither is this.

01:20:58.666 --> 01:20:59.875
Anabel!

01:21:13.708 --> 01:21:15.166
Anabel, follow me!

01:21:17.291 --> 01:21:18.125
Jump!

01:21:36.916 --> 01:21:37.750
Liv?

01:21:38.291 --> 01:21:39.458
Why'd you hit her so hard?

01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:41.458
She asked you and you wouldn't do it.

01:21:41.541 --> 01:21:43.833
I'm sorry I wouldn't hit her with a pipe!

01:21:43.916 --> 01:21:45.458
I'm gonna go to prison.

01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:47.458
-The moon...
-I'm so sorry.

01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:49.833
The blood moon is over.

01:21:49.916 --> 01:21:50.875
Are you okay?

01:21:53.125 --> 01:21:55.541
-Where's Mia?
-We found her.

01:21:55.625 --> 01:21:57.875
-Let's go. Come on.
-Easy. You're fine.

01:21:58.875 --> 01:21:59.916
Come on!

01:22:02.583 --> 01:22:04.458
-Mia!
-Liv!

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
She's fine. I checked her.
She just woke up.

01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:09.083
-How are you?
-She's a bit out of it, but fine.

01:22:09.166 --> 01:22:10.791
-She's okay?
-Where's Anabel?

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:12.125
-Are you okay?
-Anabel.

01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:14.333
-I've called an ambulance.
-Is Liv okay, though?

01:22:14.416 --> 01:22:17.083
-Holy shit.
-Liv's okay too. Well, Grayson hit her.

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:19.583
-Look at my finger.
-Somebody had to do it.

01:22:19.666 --> 01:22:21.166
What was in that gross punch?

01:22:21.708 --> 01:22:23.750
-Anabel.
-Jeez, everything's so fucked up.

01:22:23.833 --> 01:22:25.750
What happened to the book? Look!

01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:28.125
-The book's completely destroyed.
-What?

01:22:28.958 --> 01:22:30.833
-Look!
-Where did it all go?

01:22:30.916 --> 01:22:32.666
-That's crazy.
-Jas.

01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:34.416
-Let me see.
-What?

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.125
-Is it me or is your arm completely fine?
-What?

01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:41.125
-Does it hurt?
-Holy...

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:42.708
It's fine. It worked.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.791
If it worked, then where's Persephone?

01:22:44.875 --> 01:22:46.666
-I think it worked.
-It worked, man.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.375
Goodbye, Anabel.

01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:20.708
What are we looking at?

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:24.791
Persephone.

01:23:26.875 --> 01:23:29.208
-What the fuck?
-Get off me.

01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:30.708
What the hell?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I'm flattered,
but not surprised 'cause I'm popular.

01:23:36.083 --> 01:23:37.583
But still, what's going on?

01:23:38.166 --> 01:23:40.041
-Where have you been?
-What the--

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:43.208
Arthur, get off. Fuck off.

01:23:44.375 --> 01:23:46.666
I'm watching the blood moon.
Where have you been?

01:23:53.916 --> 01:23:54.833
Good night, Butter.

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.833
-Good night, Liv.
-Good night.

01:24:51.916 --> 01:24:53.333
Good morning.

01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:05.250
-Good morning, sweetie.
-Morning.

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:07.583
-Everything okay?
-More than okay, actually.

01:25:09.958 --> 01:25:11.666
Breakfast is ready, okay?

01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:13.458
Mom?

01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:15.500
Yes?

01:25:17.708 --> 01:25:21.000
Sorry that I can sometimes be...
the way that I am.

01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:25.083
The way you are is good.

01:25:26.458 --> 01:25:29.625
Like your dad used to say,
it shows that you care.

01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:36.791
Liv, I can't believe
you copied my costume.

01:25:36.875 --> 01:25:39.250
-It's a coincidence.
-She paid me to tell her.

01:25:40.666 --> 01:25:43.291
-Have fun and take care.
-Bye.

01:25:43.375 --> 01:25:44.291
Bye.

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:48.166
-You're just jealous.
-Don't touch me. You're a nightmare.

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:51.625
I used to have nightmares.
Believe me, this is nothing.

01:25:59.041 --> 01:26:03.708
You look like Liv's evil twin sister
and I do not hate it.

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:08.125
Doesn't feel like a year, does it?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.166
No.

01:26:13.541 --> 01:26:16.666
You still haven't told me
what your wish was.

01:26:17.916 --> 01:26:20.666
I wished to find someone
that I could fall in love with.

01:26:22.875 --> 01:26:24.166
Someone like you.
