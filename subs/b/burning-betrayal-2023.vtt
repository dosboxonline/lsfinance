WEBVTT

00:19.541 --> 00:24.583
BURNING BETRAYAL

01:27.333 --> 01:28.750
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY

02:44.125 --> 02:46.166
BABI AND CAIO ARE GETTING MARRIED

02:49.916 --> 02:51.041
CALLING

02:56.916 --> 02:58.958
HEY, I MISS YOU

03:08.666 --> 03:10.125
My love.

03:10.708 --> 03:11.791
Caio, you startled me!

03:11.875 --> 03:15.333
- You trying to give me a heart attack?
- No, I'd never hurt you. Hmm.

03:15.416 --> 03:17.541
- Aren't you supposed to be in Rio?
- I was.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.916
I'm only here for a one-day turnaround.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.500
I have to testify in court
for a client's case.

03:22.583 --> 03:23.791
- What for?
- Mmm.

03:23.875 --> 03:25.666
Why, are you being sued by them?

03:25.750 --> 03:28.041
No,
it's a Prosecutor's Office investigation.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.000
Money laundering.

03:29.833 --> 03:31.791
- What does that have to do with you?
- Nothing.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.750
It's normal to call
the business partners in

03:33.833 --> 03:35.750
to testify in this type of case.

03:35.833 --> 03:37.750
- It's standard protocol.
- Huh.

03:37.833 --> 03:41.041
Thiago has the accounting records
and balance sheets, it's cool.

03:41.666 --> 03:42.791
And that guy,

03:42.875 --> 03:46.166
Thiago, your partner,
is the most organized person I know.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.333
Really?

03:47.916 --> 03:49.583
Okay, fine.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.958
He's the second most
organized person that I know.

03:53.041 --> 03:55.416
After you, obviously, my love.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.583
That's better.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.750
Mmm. Hold on. Close your eyes.

04:00.458 --> 04:01.541
I got you a surprise.

04:01.625 --> 04:03.500
- Trust me.
- Caio…

04:05.708 --> 04:06.916
Open up.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.000
Wow, they're beautiful, babe! Really.

04:14.791 --> 04:17.041
- All right.
- Put 'em on for me.

04:17.541 --> 04:18.875
Let's see.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.000
Okay?

04:23.583 --> 04:25.583
- How do I look?
- Amazing.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.208
Amazing.

05:03.166 --> 05:04.875
I'm gonna come.

05:04.958 --> 05:06.875
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna come.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.166
Oh, babe.

05:15.541 --> 05:16.750
Oh, that was good.

05:18.958 --> 05:19.958
You all right?

05:21.375 --> 05:23.166
You didn't think so? Huh?

05:23.250 --> 05:25.458
- Of course, it's not that.
- What's going on?

05:28.125 --> 05:30.041
I was just thinking about the bike.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.000
The motorcycle?

05:33.916 --> 05:36.541
Yeah, someone offered to buy it,
didn't I tell you?

05:37.875 --> 05:40.000
Finally. Yeah, babe. That's good news.

05:41.166 --> 05:44.916
You've got a lot to do for the wedding
and that bike takes up a lot of your time.

05:45.916 --> 05:49.041
How was your week?
Is it too much to do all of the planning?

05:49.625 --> 05:52.458
Well, I still have
some of the decorations to figure out.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.291
But it'll all work out.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.250
I'm loving the life
we're building together.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.250
Same here.

06:02.916 --> 06:03.833
I love you.

06:06.541 --> 06:07.750
- Hungry?
- Totally.

06:07.833 --> 06:10.291
- I'll make us some spaghetti.
- Someone's excited.

06:10.375 --> 06:13.166
Makin' spaghetti.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.666
With a nice bottle of wine.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.625
Huh?

06:23.125 --> 06:26.916
Girl, it's not like that.
It wasn't one of those confusing dreams.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.250
When you open the bathroom door

06:28.333 --> 06:31.041
to find you're at the office
in your grandma's house.

06:31.125 --> 06:34.416
- This dream was real, very real.
- Okay, listen.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.166
"If you have a dream about cheating,

06:36.250 --> 06:38.541
it doesn't mean
you want to cheat on your partner."

06:38.625 --> 06:39.583
See?

06:39.666 --> 06:42.333
"It's more likely
that you're betraying yourself

06:42.416 --> 06:46.458
by making certain choices that you know
deep down are going to be wrong for you."

06:46.541 --> 06:49.166
Oh, I don't know, girl.
Let's think about this.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.125
You wanna get married?

06:51.208 --> 06:52.750
It's a huge step for you.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.000
I love Caio. Why wouldn't I want that?

06:55.083 --> 06:57.416
You haven't slept
with many guys other than Caio.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.333
Maybe you have repressed desires.

07:00.875 --> 07:04.250
I'd die of boredom if I had
to sleep with the same guy for eternity.

07:04.333 --> 07:05.500
You and I are different,

07:05.583 --> 07:08.375
I don't know how you can
trust guys from dating apps.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.875
Girl, how's that more dangerous and risky

07:10.958 --> 07:13.166
than sharing your whole life with someone?

07:13.250 --> 07:14.625
- Mm.
- Thank you.

07:15.291 --> 07:17.166
- Another refill, please.
- Hold on.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.750
I wanna download something for you.
It's a really cool app.

07:20.833 --> 07:22.125
Oh, thanks.

07:23.333 --> 07:27.041
This way I'll always know where you are,
and if you're safe.

07:27.125 --> 07:29.250
All right.
But if you get to know where I go,

07:29.333 --> 07:31.083
then I wanna know where you go.

07:31.166 --> 07:34.541
Because if one day this app shows me
that you're at a swinger's club,

07:34.625 --> 07:36.708
- I'll know your dreams came true.
- Shh!

07:36.791 --> 07:40.500
Uh, I'll need to let this out,
that's the only way to fix it.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.333
Uh, no. You won't need to.

07:42.416 --> 07:44.458
By the day of the wedding, it'll fit me!

08:01.500 --> 08:02.833
Excuse me.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.000
- Coffee?
- Heck yeah.

08:05.625 --> 08:08.166
- Thanks.
- You need anything?

08:08.250 --> 08:09.083
Mm-mm.

08:09.791 --> 08:12.208
No, I'm reviewing the transactions
that Caio made

08:12.291 --> 08:13.791
with that construction company.

08:14.375 --> 08:15.791
I wanna go to the hearing.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.583
You'd be wasting your time.

08:17.666 --> 08:21.083
It's just a preliminary hearing.
I took care of everything already.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.958
I know,
but I'm his business partner, after all.

08:24.041 --> 08:27.291
- It's my responsibility to go.
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

08:27.375 --> 08:30.375
- It's gonna be really boring.
- That's okay.

08:33.291 --> 08:34.875
Oh, look, Thiago.

08:35.416 --> 08:37.416
Uh, it looks like the twin to mine.

08:37.916 --> 08:40.208
It bums me out a little
that I'm selling it.

08:41.666 --> 08:43.083
- Then don't sell it.
- Yeah.

08:43.166 --> 08:46.666
This bike is from my old life.
It won't fit in anymore.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.625
When I have kids down the road.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.416
We're late, Babi. We should go.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.375
Yep.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.250
ROAD HARPIES MOTORCYLE CLUB

09:07.458 --> 09:09.708
- Where's Caio?
- Guess he's late.

09:51.083 --> 09:52.416
Hi, I'm here.

09:56.041 --> 09:58.000
- I got stuck in traffic, sorry.
- Okay.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.916
Good morning.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.708
I am Judge Marco Ladeia,
I will be presiding here today.

10:05.500 --> 10:09.125
Thank you for joining us.
Let's now start this preliminary hearing.

10:09.916 --> 10:12.291
Mr. Caio Siqueira, please take the stand.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.708
Will you please describe in detail,

10:17.791 --> 10:20.250
uh, the relationship
of your import company

10:20.333 --> 10:23.083
with the construction company
called Melagold,

10:23.166 --> 10:26.208
who is being accused
of irregular financial operations,

10:26.791 --> 10:28.291
conspiracy to commit fraud,

10:28.375 --> 10:30.958
and money laundering
for a known drug cartel?

10:32.875 --> 10:36.791
Well, um, I started working
with the company in 2009

10:37.458 --> 10:40.250
and since then
we've always worked with transparency.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.791
My accountant brought
all of our accounting records

10:43.875 --> 10:45.541
for Your Honor to review.

10:47.791 --> 10:50.875
And for those reasons,
as Caio's accountant, I guarantee

10:50.958 --> 10:54.791
my client had no connection to,
nor was involved in these alleged charges.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.333
That will be all for today.

10:57.416 --> 11:00.791
This hearing is now adjourned
and everyone is dismissed.

11:05.541 --> 11:06.541
I told you.

11:11.750 --> 11:12.708
Come on, let's go.

11:19.958 --> 11:22.541
Well, babe,
I gotta run off now to the airport

11:22.625 --> 11:24.708
'cause I still have
a meeting in Rio, okay?

11:24.791 --> 11:26.208
- Now?
- Yeah.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.666
- I love you. Take care of her.
- Sure thing.

11:37.916 --> 11:38.916
New car?

11:41.708 --> 11:43.083
It's a bit over the top.

11:43.958 --> 11:45.125
- By the way.
- Hm?

11:45.208 --> 11:49.333
- You wanna come to my bachelorette party?
- Isn't that just a women only thing?

11:49.416 --> 11:50.666
- You're my best friend.
- Ah.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.458
- You have privileges.
- I see.

11:52.541 --> 11:55.666
Well, you might have more fun
with just your girlfriends.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.166
- You wanna go somewhere for lunch?
- I can't.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.750
I have to say goodbye to my friend.

12:20.291 --> 12:22.333
- Hi. I am.
- Hello. You're Camille?

12:22.416 --> 12:24.583
- Take care of her.
- Sure thing.

12:48.333 --> 12:51.416
Yeah! Take it off!

12:51.500 --> 12:54.458
Hello! Take it off! Take it off! Yeah!

12:59.250 --> 13:00.458
BRIDE

13:00.541 --> 13:02.625
Did you see that?

13:11.250 --> 13:13.250
Gorgeous! My God, you are hot!

13:13.333 --> 13:14.541
Amazing!

13:14.625 --> 13:16.666
Damn, do you see his abs?

13:18.041 --> 13:21.041
Ah!

13:21.125 --> 13:23.166
Surprise!

13:23.250 --> 13:27.541
Your bachelorette party gift is here!

13:28.791 --> 13:31.916
- Girl, you've gone insane.
- It's paid. Go take him to a room.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.416
- I can't do that, no way!
- Loosen up. Caio will never suspect.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.708
Why not enjoy it?

13:37.458 --> 13:39.166
I won't do it. You paid for it.

13:39.250 --> 13:41.416
- You'll have more fun.
- You're serious?

13:41.500 --> 13:43.875
- Just go before I regret it.
- I'll do it for you!

13:43.958 --> 13:46.083
- Go!
- I'll be quick, promise. Come on.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.708
Come with me, you gorgeous, sexy man!

13:48.791 --> 13:50.416
- Come on!
- You go girl!

13:57.541 --> 13:59.458
Oh, my God!

13:59.541 --> 14:02.208
It's from you?
All right, let's see, huh.

14:02.291 --> 14:03.291
Show us.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.833
Ooh!

14:05.916 --> 14:08.250
You got me a clit-sucker.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.375
After a couple of years of marriage,
I bet you'll use it more than Caio.

14:11.458 --> 14:13.625
Well, thanks.

14:13.708 --> 14:17.333
- I got everyone's gift, right?
- You have one more. Hold on.

14:17.416 --> 14:19.041
- Ooh, who's is it?
- Who is it?

14:19.125 --> 14:22.541
"For Babi,
a little surprise from a secret admirer."

14:25.125 --> 14:28.458
- Open it! Open it!
- Open it! Open it!

14:28.541 --> 14:30.833
Oh, my goodness.

14:31.916 --> 14:33.041
So mysterious.

14:40.875 --> 14:41.708
Babi?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.458
- Look.
- It's Caio!

15:15.125 --> 15:17.250
- It's Caio with someone else.
- Babi?

15:17.333 --> 15:19.625
He's with another girl.

15:19.708 --> 15:21.416
I don't believe it.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.958
Babi?

15:26.041 --> 15:28.291
Open the door, babe.
Come on out.

15:28.375 --> 15:31.083
- No.
- Everyone's gone home.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.333
I'm never coming out of here.

15:34.916 --> 15:36.500
Please, come on, Babi!

15:36.583 --> 15:37.958
- Paty--
- I'm so glad you're here.

15:38.041 --> 15:40.375
I've tried everything
but she won't come out!

15:40.458 --> 15:42.166
I can hear you!

15:42.750 --> 15:44.208
Oh, my God.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.041
Hey Babi. Look, it's Thiago.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.500
Open the door, please.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.666
Why bother, huh?

15:50.750 --> 15:53.708
To look everyone in the eye
and tell them the wedding's off?

15:54.208 --> 15:56.916
That the man I love
is a liar and a cheater?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.750
- I'd rather die than come out.
- Come on, Babi.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.666
There's a ton of us who love you
and want to see you happy.

16:02.750 --> 16:06.750
Why did he do that to me, Thiago?

16:06.833 --> 16:08.541
Honestly, I don't know, Babi.

16:09.541 --> 16:12.541
But I'm so, so sorry, really.

16:12.625 --> 16:16.208
I swear I'll do anything you say.
Ask whatever you want. I'll do it.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.791
There's somewhere I wanna go.

16:37.541 --> 16:41.375
Babi, this is a really bad idea.
Why cause yourself even more pain?

16:41.458 --> 16:44.541
Stop being a wimp, Thiago.
It's a damn good idea.

16:44.625 --> 16:46.375
If this is what Babi wants,
we're doing it.

16:46.458 --> 16:49.666
I really need to know who this woman is.
I need to know about her.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.666
What her name is?
How long they've been dating?

16:52.750 --> 16:55.208
- How long has he been cheating?
- All right.

16:56.291 --> 16:57.125
Let's go.

17:00.875 --> 17:04.333
- Good evening, Júnior.
- Good evening. What can I help you with?

17:04.916 --> 17:07.458
You remember Babi, right?
She's Caio's fiancé.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So, we need to go to his office to, uh--

17:10.083 --> 17:12.291
Actually, she needs to go there and, uh,

17:12.375 --> 17:14.583
go get something for him
that she left there.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.000
If you could let us up,
that would be really great.

17:19.416 --> 17:23.708
Unfortunately, there's no way I can
let you in without Caio's permission.

17:23.791 --> 17:27.041
- I understand completely, that's what--
- Here's the thing.

17:27.708 --> 17:30.375
Their wedding is right around the corner
and he's traveling.

17:30.958 --> 17:33.458
She wants to leave him a surprise present.

17:33.541 --> 17:36.375
You don't want to ruin
a nice thing like that, huh?

17:36.458 --> 17:38.708
The world needs more romance.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.500
Don't you think?

17:42.333 --> 17:43.166
Why not?

17:44.625 --> 17:45.708
Told you.

17:52.416 --> 17:55.416
- This has to be quick.
- It'll be fast. It'll be really quick.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.291
- I'm supposed to cover the desk.
- Fuck no.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.833
Hey, so, hum, come this way with me.

18:01.916 --> 18:04.083
I want to tell you something in private.

18:06.125 --> 18:08.166
- Come one!
- Babi. Babi, wait.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.416
I wanna find out
everything about this woman!

18:10.500 --> 18:13.541
- This is crazy.
- His laptop, it's gotta have something.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.041
Even if you find something,
you're only gonna get hurt.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.291
I don't care!

18:17.375 --> 18:18.916
All right. Password.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.916
I can't stay much.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.750
Come here, let me show you something.

18:22.833 --> 18:25.833
- What is it? Show me.
- A sweet little treat!

18:25.916 --> 18:27.958
- Oh yeah! This is how I like it.
- Oh!

18:28.041 --> 18:31.125
- You wanna see this big boy? Huh?
- Oh, yeah. I wanna see.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.958
My birthday? No way.

18:33.041 --> 18:34.541
Idiot. You're an idiot!

18:35.458 --> 18:36.708
We should leave.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.541
Fucking hell!

18:38.625 --> 18:41.458
- I'm busted if anyone hears them.
- I only wanna hear you.

18:43.166 --> 18:45.250
Oh, just keep your eyes here.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.166
I doubt he would leave
anything here. We should go.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.750
"To Nicole,

18:58.416 --> 19:00.583
happy two-year anniversary, my love.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.875
Cheers to many more. I love you. Caio."

19:13.375 --> 19:15.250
<i>He's been with her for two years.</i>

19:18.583 --> 19:20.458
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

19:22.666 --> 19:24.125
I think we should just leave.

19:25.041 --> 19:26.250
Son of a bitch!

19:29.250 --> 19:31.041
- I'm close!
- Bastard!

19:31.125 --> 19:33.666
Screw this! He's gonna pay for this shit.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.000
Screw him and fuck all these contracts.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.000
- I should go check.
- Oh yeah! Oh!

19:38.083 --> 19:39.666
It's his bottle of Scotch!

19:39.750 --> 19:42.125
Do you know how much this thing costs?
Fuck it!

19:42.791 --> 19:45.166
And this one.
Always talking about his whiskey.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.291
- Another one. Nice bottle. Fucking dick!
- Babi…

19:48.375 --> 19:52.250
Bastard. The glasses I bought him
when he opened his office.

19:54.666 --> 19:57.125
I'm gonna get fire, I'm serious.
You can text me.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.208
Stay. Don't tell me that's all you've got.

19:59.291 --> 20:00.416
Not even close.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.500
- Clown! Stupid idiot!
- Babi. Babi.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.083
- Wait, Babi!
- Stop, Thiago!

20:05.166 --> 20:07.583
- Give me your coat. Give me your coat.
- What for?

20:07.666 --> 20:10.125
- Give it to me.
- Let's see it.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.625
You wanna see my big sucker?

20:11.708 --> 20:13.458
Uh-huh.

20:15.666 --> 20:19.208
You can't take his laptop.
We could go to jail, and we'll be fucked!

20:19.291 --> 20:22.000
Everything's already fucked. Let's go.

20:27.458 --> 20:28.458
Come on, Thiago!

20:28.541 --> 20:30.791
- Hey, I really gotta leave.
- No, just wait.

20:30.875 --> 20:33.833
- I need to go. No.
- Wait a sec. Stay. I won't let you leave.

20:33.916 --> 20:34.916
Babi…

20:35.000 --> 20:36.833
The noise came
from somewhere else.

20:36.916 --> 20:38.541
Oh.There they are.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.625
- Did everything work?
- It did.

20:40.708 --> 20:43.583
My dear fiancé will adore
the gift I left for him.

20:44.916 --> 20:48.083
I'll fill you in later.
Just text me, 'kay?

20:52.458 --> 20:54.666
You guys, don't judge me, okay?
Just don't.

20:54.750 --> 20:58.125
Oh my God, that was the craziest stunt
I think I've ever done.

21:09.375 --> 21:12.916
Babi, you sure you don't want
either of us to stay with you tonight?

21:13.833 --> 21:15.708
Yeah, I just wanna be alone, okay?

21:16.958 --> 21:19.125
All right girl. Take care, yeah?

21:19.208 --> 21:21.833
- Thanks.
- You should get some rest, okay?

21:35.125 --> 21:36.208
Alexa,

21:37.166 --> 21:38.750
why did he cheat on me?

21:38.833 --> 21:41.625
<i>I'm not able</i>
<i>to find an answer to your question.</i>

21:55.041 --> 21:55.958
Shit.

22:32.083 --> 22:35.583
I'm trying to pretend that I'm okay,
but I'm not, I'm not all right.

22:37.583 --> 22:40.000
But I will be.I will be okay.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.125
Babi?

22:50.208 --> 22:52.750
Babi?

22:54.166 --> 22:55.708
Babi! Come on!

22:55.791 --> 22:58.125
- Open this or I'll break it down!
- Calm down.

22:58.208 --> 22:59.666
Here, I'm here.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.000
- What's this?
- You need to snap out of this.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.541
I'm not ready to snap out of it just yet.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.958
But you are.
Now wash your face and come out.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.125
Hey.

23:20.458 --> 23:21.583
How's it going?

23:21.666 --> 23:22.791
Ah, man.

23:23.416 --> 23:24.250
No idea.

23:24.916 --> 23:27.250
I don't know what I want, what I like.

23:27.833 --> 23:29.416
It's like an identity crisis.

23:30.708 --> 23:31.666
Suggestion.

23:32.166 --> 23:35.500
What would you never do to your hair
if you were still with Caio?

23:35.583 --> 23:36.541
Hmm?

23:47.166 --> 23:49.208
Gorgeous!

23:55.875 --> 23:59.291
I want to cut all our ties with Caio.
I don't want his business here.

24:00.125 --> 24:01.125
Wow.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.125
- First, good morning.
- Good morning.

24:04.208 --> 24:05.458
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

24:05.541 --> 24:07.416
Today, we're cancelling his contract.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.916
If I were you, I would watch out for him.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.875
A liar like him will do whatever he has to
and might screw you.

24:12.958 --> 24:15.583
I understand
how you're feeling, Babi.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.666
You're totally right.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.625
But as your friend, I have to warn you.

24:22.750 --> 24:25.125
You can't let your emotions take control.

24:25.208 --> 24:28.291
His business represents
almost a third of our income.

24:28.791 --> 24:30.666
We can't cut him out this quickly.

24:30.750 --> 24:34.333
- You don't wanna be too hasty.
- Yeah, but Thiago,

24:34.416 --> 24:36.791
I don't want him here, I don't--

24:36.875 --> 24:39.500
- Wait.
- Take the call. I'll be in my office.

24:39.583 --> 24:41.708
Okay.

24:44.166 --> 24:45.916
- Hello?
<i>- Bárbara?</i>

24:46.000 --> 24:48.666
<i>This is João,</i>
<i>Judge Marco Ladeia's assistant.</i>

24:48.750 --> 24:51.708
<i>I left you a few messages,</i>
<i>but wasn't able to reach you.</i>

24:51.791 --> 24:53.458
<i>Your folder is still here.</i>

24:54.458 --> 24:57.416
Um, all right, good,
I'll come pick it up. Thanks.

25:04.791 --> 25:05.875
Hey there.

25:05.958 --> 25:07.708
I'm here to grab my folder.

25:08.291 --> 25:09.625
You're Bárbara, right?

25:09.708 --> 25:10.916
Yes, sir.

25:11.000 --> 25:11.875
Please.

25:13.000 --> 25:13.833
This way.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.708
- Thanks.
- Of course.

25:40.166 --> 25:42.583
- You're the one who forgot the folder.
- Mm-hmm.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.958
Marco. Nice to meet you.

25:46.541 --> 25:49.083
Bárbara. But you can call me Babi.

25:50.083 --> 25:50.916
Babi.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.208
Uh, excuse me.

25:55.291 --> 25:56.583
Here's your folder.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.125
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

26:03.625 --> 26:04.708
Mm, I'm gonna go.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.416
Thanks again.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.000
Thank you.

26:18.083 --> 26:19.041
What's so funny?

26:41.916 --> 26:45.125
"The Road Harpies Motorcycle Club.

26:45.208 --> 26:46.416
Interesting.

26:48.166 --> 26:49.083
Babi.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.875
Caio? What are you doing here?

26:51.958 --> 26:54.291
- I need to talk to you.
- Are you following me?

26:54.375 --> 26:56.291
- You're avoiding me.
- Yeah, we have nothing

26:56.375 --> 26:58.458
to say to each other even again.

26:58.541 --> 27:00.666
I'm just asking
for a chance to explain myself.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.375
- Please.
- Explain what, Caio?

27:02.458 --> 27:03.375
What?

27:03.458 --> 27:04.375
I love you.

27:04.875 --> 27:06.083
I'm not with her, okay?

27:07.833 --> 27:11.291
You and I have been together five years.
Can we go somewhere and talk?

27:11.375 --> 27:14.000
- Let's figure this out.
- And in those five years<i>,</i>

27:14.083 --> 27:15.625
two years you were with her.

27:17.125 --> 27:19.708
You're a bastard.
There's nothing you could say.

27:19.791 --> 27:21.250
- Wait, just--
- Don't touch me!

27:21.333 --> 27:22.916
Is this guy bothering you?

27:28.708 --> 27:30.666
We're just discussing a private matter.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.041
I want you to leave.

27:35.416 --> 27:36.291
I'll go.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.250
But I won't give up on us.

27:50.166 --> 27:51.083
Are you all right?

27:51.708 --> 27:52.625
Yeah.

27:53.666 --> 27:54.708
I'm okay.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.041
Thank you.

28:05.875 --> 28:06.833
Thank you.

28:10.291 --> 28:12.333
Another one, please.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.625
- Feeling better?
- Sure.

28:15.791 --> 28:17.500
No, I'm pissed.

28:19.833 --> 28:21.166
Who's that guy to you?

28:21.250 --> 28:22.291
Ex-fiancé.

28:23.166 --> 28:24.333
Current stalker.

28:25.791 --> 28:26.750
Always an asshole.

28:28.375 --> 28:32.500
There should be a way to create some kind
of magnetic field around our exes.

28:32.583 --> 28:34.875
Like when an ex appears, then, pow!

28:34.958 --> 28:37.125
They're shocked and sent flying backwards.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.041
Are you married?

28:42.333 --> 28:43.625
Uh, no. I'm…

28:44.208 --> 28:48.375
just like the kind of person who needs
this magnetic field, like you said.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.875
Uh, do you know that woman?

28:59.916 --> 29:01.458
Be right back. Just a minute.

29:01.541 --> 29:03.250
Yeah, do what you got to do.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.958
Mm. The check, please.

29:22.958 --> 29:24.750
- Hey, Paty.
<i>- Hey, girl.</i>

29:24.833 --> 29:26.666
Sorry I took so long. I'm on a date,

29:26.750 --> 29:29.666
the guy was in the middle of a sentence,
you know I'm polite.

29:29.750 --> 29:31.000
<i>I didn't want to interrupt.</i>

29:31.083 --> 29:33.958
No, go back to your date, silly.
We can always talk later.

29:34.041 --> 29:36.958
No, no. We can talk now. This guy is dull.

29:37.041 --> 29:39.250
He talks too much
and I just wanna get laid!

29:39.333 --> 29:41.916
He already told me
the name of his ex's turtle!

29:42.000 --> 29:45.083
It's not a big deal.
I just wanted to tell you something.

29:45.166 --> 29:47.500
Remember that really hot judge
from the hearing?

29:47.583 --> 29:48.583
<i>Yeah. You hooked up?</i>

29:48.666 --> 29:51.250
Well, no.
I thought something might happen,

29:51.333 --> 29:53.583
because we went for a drink
by the courthouse,

29:53.666 --> 29:56.583
but then this woman showed up
and she kept staring,

29:56.666 --> 29:58.291
then he got all tense and weird.

29:58.375 --> 29:59.541
So I just left.

29:59.625 --> 30:00.916
Yeah, that's weird.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.416
I know, so I tried to do a search
and found nothing on the guy.

30:04.500 --> 30:07.666
Nothing. Not one photo,
there's no social media, nothing.

30:07.750 --> 30:09.083
<i>He's a ghost.</i>

30:09.166 --> 30:11.791
Hey, girl, sorry, say that again,
I didn't hear you.

30:11.875 --> 30:14.208
<i>Forget it.</i>
<i>I'm almost home. I'll call you later.</i>

30:14.291 --> 30:15.708
- Yep. Later.
- <i>Bye.</i>

31:33.333 --> 31:34.958
Thiago, where are you?

31:35.500 --> 31:37.958
Uh, someone broke into my place
and tore it apart.

31:38.041 --> 31:39.291
Can you come over?

31:49.250 --> 31:51.583
Doesn't look like anything's missing here.

31:51.666 --> 31:53.583
Nothing was taken from here either.

31:58.708 --> 32:02.041
- Thanks for coming, for real.
- Of course, Babi.

32:02.125 --> 32:03.875
- I was worried.
- I'm all right.

32:05.125 --> 32:09.125
Well, apparently it wasn't a robbery.
It's more like a…

32:09.208 --> 32:10.958
- Yeah.
- …a really big mess.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.583
- You know who I think did it?
- Hm?

32:14.666 --> 32:15.875
It was Caio.

32:16.750 --> 32:18.750
Why would he do this?

32:19.250 --> 32:20.541
No idea, Thiago.

32:21.166 --> 32:23.208
I saw him earlier at the courthouse.

32:23.291 --> 32:25.458
We just argued,
and Marco came to my rescue.

32:26.125 --> 32:29.208
- Marco?
- The judge from the hearing, remember?

32:29.291 --> 32:31.750
I left my folder there
so I went back to grab it.

32:32.250 --> 32:35.000
Okay, but what were you doing
before Caio got there?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.916
Hey, can't I know about it?

32:38.500 --> 32:39.458
You guys dating?

32:40.458 --> 32:41.333
No.

32:42.291 --> 32:43.750
- No, I mean it.
- Hm.

32:43.833 --> 32:46.833
Seriously, we're not together.
There was a spark, we had a drink.

32:46.916 --> 32:48.791
That's it, not a big deal.

32:49.625 --> 32:50.750
I don't know, Babi.

32:51.833 --> 32:52.791
Be careful.

32:53.458 --> 32:56.541
I think it's really strange
that this judge is hanging around.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.625
Seriously, you're vulnerable.

33:00.208 --> 33:01.375
I want you to be happy.

33:01.458 --> 33:05.041
I want you to go back to the Babi

33:05.125 --> 33:08.041
who's a ray of sunshine and vibrant,
like you used to be.

33:08.625 --> 33:09.625
I want that too.

33:10.416 --> 33:14.250
But I think I lost that version of me
during those five years with Caio.

33:14.875 --> 33:16.708
I don't really know who I am anyone.

33:18.625 --> 33:19.708
I know who you are.

33:20.291 --> 33:23.416
You're an amazing woman
who's just going through a rough patch.

33:24.166 --> 33:26.541
And know that I'm always here for you.

33:28.333 --> 33:29.333
I know you are.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.375
But not just as a friend.

33:34.041 --> 33:35.541
I can be more than that, Babi.

33:38.041 --> 33:39.000
I'm also…

33:54.000 --> 33:57.208
Um… It's-- I mean, um…
We really shouldn't.

33:57.291 --> 33:59.875
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too. I'm not doing well.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.291
Well…So…

34:04.000 --> 34:06.708
do you need any more help with this mess?

34:06.791 --> 34:10.500
No.It'll be a good distraction
for me to clean this up tonight.

34:11.791 --> 34:13.708
- See you tomorrow?
- Count on it.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.083
- Good night.
- Good night.

34:20.375 --> 34:21.666
Get some rest.

34:21.750 --> 34:23.541
- I will.
- See ya.

34:30.083 --> 34:33.333
<i>Hey, Camille, how's it going?</i>
<i>Uh, it's Babi. Do you remember me?</i>

34:33.416 --> 34:36.916
Actually, something has come up,
and I really need to get my bike back.

35:07.333 --> 35:09.166
Are you the new girl?

35:09.250 --> 35:10.791
That's right. Babi.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.333
- Alexandre.
- Nice to see you.

35:13.416 --> 35:16.041
The guys were excited
to see what you're about.

35:16.125 --> 35:18.625
It's been a while
since we had a girl in the club.

35:18.708 --> 35:21.333
I'm sure it can't be easy
being around all these men.

35:22.083 --> 35:24.791
- What's the hold-up then?
- Still waiting on one guy.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.750
Finally.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.500
All right, let's hit it!

36:12.958 --> 36:14.750
You're lucky I haven't ridden in awhile.

36:14.833 --> 36:18.166
Or I'd already be at the pool in my bikini
waiting for you guys.

36:19.375 --> 36:20.500
Oh, yeah?

36:25.083 --> 36:27.166
I saw this bike over at the courthouse.

36:27.791 --> 36:29.541
I had no idea it was yours.

36:30.041 --> 36:33.208
If I'd seen your ride, I wouldn't
have figured it belonged to you.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.375
Want a hand?

36:39.458 --> 36:40.333
Thanks.

36:44.958 --> 36:47.041
Well, this is a nice surprise.

37:17.041 --> 37:18.458
What do you like to drink?

37:19.000 --> 37:22.291
Try taking a guess.
What do you think I like to drink?

37:22.375 --> 37:23.541
Ah…

37:23.625 --> 37:25.750
I bet you'd drink something like maybe…

37:26.458 --> 37:27.291
champagne.

37:28.208 --> 37:30.416
- The expensive kind.
- Not a bad guess.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.166
Open a bottle of champagne please!
Give me your best.

37:35.333 --> 37:36.708
It's my treat, all right?

37:36.791 --> 37:39.666
Consider it a welcome present
for joining our little club.

37:40.291 --> 37:43.583
If I had known I'd get treated this well,
I would've joined sooner.

37:43.666 --> 37:45.958
Yeah, you get special treatment.

37:46.541 --> 37:49.416
I wouldn't get a glass of tap water
for these hooligans.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.666
- Thanks.
- You got it.

37:51.750 --> 37:54.416
- Oh, look who decided to join us.
- Hi.

37:55.875 --> 37:59.708
I reserved the best spot on the beach
to watch the sunset together.

38:00.375 --> 38:01.291
Wanna come along?

38:04.125 --> 38:04.958
Why not?

38:06.333 --> 38:07.875
This is really good, thanks.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Great spot that you got for us out here.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.875
I love this view.

38:30.750 --> 38:33.500
- I've never brought anyone here.
- Really?

38:34.166 --> 38:36.666
I just got used
to always doing things alone.

38:38.416 --> 38:39.541
Actually, I prefer it.

38:40.208 --> 38:41.166
Except,

38:42.208 --> 38:43.541
with you, it's different.

38:46.250 --> 38:48.458
Will you think I'm crazy
if I tell you something?

38:48.541 --> 38:49.625
What is it?

38:49.708 --> 38:52.875
I think you were in one of my dreams
before we met each other.

38:53.375 --> 38:54.958
- You serious?
- Yeah, I swear.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.083
What was the dream about?

38:58.166 --> 39:00.583
I don't know if I have the guts
to tell you that.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.291
Try.

39:05.791 --> 39:06.666
Okay.

39:07.541 --> 39:10.250
We were just, um, riding our motorcycles,

39:10.333 --> 39:12.708
going superfast, and it was raining…

39:12.791 --> 39:13.916
Mm-hmm.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.916
Then you hurt your arm
because you fell off your bike.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.458
And then we went into a dark warehouse.

39:20.041 --> 39:21.750
- And?
- And…

39:25.000 --> 39:26.083
Take a guess.

39:38.125 --> 39:39.208
Is that a good guess?

39:39.833 --> 39:40.666
Uh-huh.

39:47.750 --> 39:48.958
You wanna answer that?

39:49.041 --> 39:50.791
I'm sorry.

39:51.875 --> 39:52.750
Hello?

39:53.708 --> 39:55.166
What? No.

39:55.250 --> 39:56.208
Meaning?

39:56.875 --> 39:59.000
Unbelievable. Again?

40:00.208 --> 40:02.458
Sorry, this is urgent.
I have to deal with it.

40:03.041 --> 40:04.250
Yeah?

40:04.333 --> 40:06.875
No, I can get there on my bike.
I'll be there soon.

40:10.333 --> 40:11.208
Okay.

40:13.375 --> 40:15.958
If this shit keeps happening,
I might go ballistic.

40:32.666 --> 40:35.583
You mean he just left you there, alone?
This guy's a joker.

40:35.666 --> 40:38.208
<i>Tell me about it.</i>
<i>I really wanted to hook up with him.</i>

40:38.291 --> 40:39.375
<i>I mean, it felt good.</i>

40:39.458 --> 40:41.583
<i>So are you gonna hook up with him later?</i>

40:41.666 --> 40:44.458
No clue. I think he's already gone.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.250
And the way he left was kinda weird, too.

40:48.041 --> 40:50.041
It's the universe
trying to give me a sign.

40:50.125 --> 40:51.125
"Forcing is no good."

40:51.208 --> 40:52.541
<i>Hey, I'm wearing these.</i>

40:53.125 --> 40:53.958
Let me see.

40:54.583 --> 40:56.125
<i>Girl, those panties are horrid.</i>

40:56.208 --> 41:00.083
- Exactly, my dear. These are perfect!
- And why is that?

41:00.166 --> 41:02.541
Uh, I don't really
wanna sleep with this guy.

41:02.625 --> 41:06.875
If I wanna go to his house to fuck around,
I'll remember I'm wearing these panties,

41:06.958 --> 41:07.791
<i>and I won't go.</i>

41:07.875 --> 41:09.833
Why go out with the guy?

41:09.916 --> 41:13.166
I hate staying around here
with nothing to do on the weekend!

41:13.750 --> 41:16.708
That makes sense why you'd need
to wear those panties.

41:16.791 --> 41:19.166
- Hm. Bye, Paty, <i>tchau!</i>
<i>- All right, bye.</i>

41:56.208 --> 41:57.291
Babi?

41:57.875 --> 41:59.708
A few of us are gonna go eat.

42:00.333 --> 42:02.166
And we can get more drinks.

42:02.250 --> 42:03.291
Wanna come with?

42:04.833 --> 42:07.875
Thanks, although,
I'd rather take a walk on the beach.

42:08.583 --> 42:09.916
Want company?

42:10.000 --> 42:11.416
No, thanks.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.666
Gotta shoot my shot.

43:15.250 --> 43:18.583
- I'm really sorry about earlier, Babi.
- You don't have to explain.

43:19.541 --> 43:21.958
I did want to hook up with you earlier.

43:22.458 --> 43:23.541
But that's all.

43:24.041 --> 43:27.166
I'm not looking for a boyfriend
or anything that serious.

43:27.250 --> 43:30.333
So please, there's no need
to waste your time with excuses.

43:31.041 --> 43:31.916
I got it.

43:32.541 --> 43:33.458
More or less.

43:33.958 --> 43:35.333
What I'm saying…

43:36.958 --> 43:39.041
is if you're gonna waste your time on me…

43:41.541 --> 43:42.958
then do something different.

45:30.416 --> 45:32.250
It's a race? Yeah?

47:10.208 --> 47:12.833
<i>"I had to go.</i>
<i>One day, I'll tell you my story.</i>

47:12.916 --> 47:14.916
<i>Thank you for the best night of my life."</i>

47:31.375 --> 47:33.791
- Good morning.
- We were all waiting for you.

47:34.666 --> 47:35.708
We can go now.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.333
Uh, look.

47:41.208 --> 47:44.291
I don't know what's up with you and Marco,
but don't stress.

47:44.916 --> 47:47.583
That guy is strange.
He doesn't talk to any of the guys.

47:48.583 --> 47:51.500
He's kinda mysterious.
You might wanna keep your distance.

48:33.791 --> 48:37.500
STAY AWAY FROM MARCO

48:39.708 --> 48:42.583
- Wow, Babi. That's super creepy.
- Right?

48:42.666 --> 48:44.416
At least the sex was good though.

48:44.500 --> 48:47.250
- Stop, okay? Quit playing.
- I'm sorry.

48:47.875 --> 48:50.750
- You should file a police report.
- Who do I file it against?

48:50.833 --> 48:52.583
I have no idea who did this.

48:52.666 --> 48:56.458
I mean, it could've been Caio,
for obvious reasons. But--

48:56.541 --> 48:58.125
- Bye. See ya.
- Goodbye.

48:59.625 --> 49:01.458
It might've been his other ex.

49:01.541 --> 49:04.750
It could be that crazy lady
from the bar when I went with Marco.

49:05.333 --> 49:06.250
Maybe it's Thiago.

49:06.333 --> 49:08.000
- Thiago?
- Not so loud.

49:08.666 --> 49:11.416
- But he's your partner. And best friend.
- I know.

49:11.500 --> 49:15.000
You're right, but things were so weird
the last time I talked to him.

49:15.083 --> 49:16.458
- I never told you.
- Hmm.

49:16.541 --> 49:18.833
He came to my house
and confessed how he felt.

49:19.458 --> 49:20.291
And then?

49:20.375 --> 49:23.041
He said he wanted to be
more than friends. Ugh.

49:23.125 --> 49:25.750
And? Tell me right now. What'd he do next?

49:25.833 --> 49:26.875
Then he kissed me.

49:26.958 --> 49:28.750
- Say what? On the mouth?
- Uh-huh.

49:28.833 --> 49:30.625
No, on my cheek. Of course, Paty.

49:30.708 --> 49:33.041
I am so shocked. Gossip of the year.

49:34.541 --> 49:35.583
I'm so confused.

49:36.166 --> 49:37.583
I don't know what to think.

49:37.666 --> 49:40.250
No, wait. I couldn't have been Thiago.
You know why?

49:40.916 --> 49:43.041
The same night
that you were at the resort,

49:43.125 --> 49:47.291
he was with a group of friends,
there's no way he could've followed you.

49:47.375 --> 49:49.916
- How do you know?
- Well, look at this.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
See, he posted this video.
He was nowhere near you.

49:53.083 --> 49:54.791
I'm glad you saw this.

49:54.875 --> 49:57.500
See what I'm going through?
I'm going crazy.

49:57.583 --> 50:00.541
- Especially if I suspect my best friend.
- Calm down.

50:00.625 --> 50:02.750
Calm down. Anyone would be confused.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.750
- Thanks so much.
- No, listen up.

50:04.833 --> 50:08.041
Do not let these fools get you upset.
Because you are a goddess.

50:08.125 --> 50:10.958
- Yeah.
- Focus on what you want, on your dreams.

50:11.041 --> 50:12.291
Snap out of it.

50:12.375 --> 50:14.708
- Now, come on. Let's go.
- Yeah, enough of this.

50:38.958 --> 50:40.583
MISSED CALL

51:06.125 --> 51:08.458
<i>"Expensive whiskeys."</i>

51:08.541 --> 51:12.541
<i>"Good Saints,</i>
<i>a rare collection from 1937."</i>

51:17.750 --> 51:18.708
You're mine!

51:19.375 --> 51:20.791
Got you, sucker.

51:25.375 --> 51:27.625
IMPORT CONTRACT

51:36.958 --> 51:38.416
- Thiago.
- Yeah?

51:38.500 --> 51:39.583
Come in here.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.500
Look at this.

51:47.458 --> 51:49.500
Do you know how serious this is, Thiago?

51:50.083 --> 51:52.916
Fake accounts that were never
set up through our company.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.791
- How did you miss this?
- No way.

51:54.875 --> 51:57.166
He's involved
in that construction lawsuit.

51:57.250 --> 51:59.958
- He's been scamming us since the start.
- Son of a bitch.

52:00.041 --> 52:01.416
This is serious.

52:01.500 --> 52:04.333
I thought he was going overboard
with his spending.

52:04.416 --> 52:07.208
- I didn't want to worry you about it.
- Now what?

52:07.791 --> 52:08.791
I don't know, Babi.

52:09.541 --> 52:12.125
I could go over to his office.
I wanna kick his ass.

52:12.208 --> 52:15.125
No, no. Hold on.
Right now we need to use our heads.

52:15.708 --> 52:17.208
- Just keep it cool.
- No way.

52:17.291 --> 52:18.708
- Yeah.
- How, Babi?

52:19.291 --> 52:22.666
This guy's a criminal, a crook.
He's not the Caio you used to know.

52:23.166 --> 52:25.750
- He should be punished for what he did.
- Look at me.

52:25.833 --> 52:28.291
If you give him a beating,
he'll have grounds to sue you,

52:28.375 --> 52:31.083
giving him time to clear himself,
any evidence is gone!

52:31.875 --> 52:33.500
We need to be smarter than him.

52:34.458 --> 52:37.541
We have to keep this laptop
and take it to the Prosecutor.

52:38.041 --> 52:39.791
Or we take it right to the judge!

52:40.375 --> 52:41.708
- Marco?
- Yes.

52:43.208 --> 52:44.875
I think he'd help us with this.

52:45.500 --> 52:48.875
Okay. But I think we should take it
to our lawyers first.

52:49.833 --> 52:53.416
They should weigh in on this.
Who knows, they might have a better idea.

52:53.500 --> 52:55.125
- Okay.
- Babi.

52:55.875 --> 52:58.208
I swear I didn't know anything.

52:58.291 --> 53:00.458
I refuse
to be an accomplice to this crime.

53:00.541 --> 53:01.791
Yeah, same here.

53:02.416 --> 53:04.666
I got your back on this no matter what.

53:06.125 --> 53:07.208
Wait a second.

53:08.541 --> 53:11.083
Excuse me, are you, uh, Bárbara Vieira?

53:11.166 --> 53:13.333
- I have a delivery for you.
- Thanks.

53:13.416 --> 53:14.500
Bye now.

53:16.333 --> 53:17.458
Who sent those?

53:18.541 --> 53:19.500
Marco.

53:19.583 --> 53:21.125
That figures.

53:21.791 --> 53:23.666
Look, Babi, don't get me wrong.

53:24.166 --> 53:27.125
I think it's really strange
how this judge is harassing you.

53:27.666 --> 53:30.000
- Yikes, Thiago, for real.
- No, not "yikes".

53:30.750 --> 53:32.833
Didn't you tell me to watch out?

53:33.958 --> 53:36.166
There are a lot of bad guys in the world.

53:38.416 --> 53:39.875
- Sorry.
- <i>Tchau.</i>

53:40.500 --> 53:42.208
He's jealous. Ignore him.

53:42.833 --> 53:44.000
Read it, Paty.

53:45.458 --> 53:48.166
"I'm sorry for the way
I left the other day.

53:48.250 --> 53:50.250
How about dinner tomorrow at my place?

53:50.333 --> 53:52.708
I'll send you a car at 7pm sharp."

53:52.791 --> 53:54.208
Hmm, that's classy.

53:54.291 --> 53:56.958
I don't think so.
I don't wanna go either, okay?

53:57.875 --> 54:00.750
After all the crap I've been through
with Caio, I can't risk it.

54:01.458 --> 54:05.458
And what if Thiago's right?
If Marco is, uh, a snake after all?

54:05.541 --> 54:07.875
If you keep thinking
that every guy is a liar,

54:07.958 --> 54:10.416
you're never gonna get another date.
You know I'm right.

54:10.500 --> 54:12.958
I don't know
if he deserves a second chance.

54:13.041 --> 54:14.208
You know what I think?

54:14.791 --> 54:17.000
I think some of the best things in life

54:17.083 --> 54:19.500
are miracles disguised as second chances.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.875
I'm not saying this
so you give Marco another chance.

54:23.500 --> 54:24.708
Why not give yourself one?

54:25.708 --> 54:27.666
Poetic. Is that one yours?

54:27.750 --> 54:31.458
No, but it doesn't matter if I read it
off a fortune cookie or in a book.

54:31.541 --> 54:33.000
What matters is the message.

56:26.958 --> 56:29.125
I was afraid you wouldn't come tonight.

56:29.708 --> 56:31.500
And I was afraid to come over.

56:32.791 --> 56:33.875
I'm glad you're here.

56:34.375 --> 56:35.875
- May I?
- Yes.

56:44.625 --> 56:46.791
I set up a little place for us out here.

56:55.750 --> 56:56.791
Thank you.

57:05.625 --> 57:07.791
- Pour you some wine?
- Please do.

57:10.375 --> 57:13.333
- I hope you like rack of lamb.
- Did you make this?

57:13.416 --> 57:14.375
Mm-hmm.

57:17.291 --> 57:19.625
I suspected
that he'd been stealing from his partner.

57:19.708 --> 57:22.083
- And then?
- Then I confronted the guy,

57:22.166 --> 57:25.958
in front of everyone and, of course,
she took his side, and I was let go.

57:27.166 --> 57:30.208
It took several months
of paying off the janitor to give me

57:30.291 --> 57:32.750
all the guy's trash after his shift ended.

57:32.833 --> 57:37.375
That's how I managed to find the evidence
I needed to put together a written report,

57:37.458 --> 57:40.208
then I sent it to his partner's house
with flowers.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.583
After that, she ended their partnership,

57:43.875 --> 57:47.625
and then offered me a job,
but by that time, I was focused

57:47.708 --> 57:50.250
on trying to become a judge,
but I needed to study,

57:50.333 --> 57:52.458
- so I turned it down.
- Wow.

57:52.958 --> 57:54.625
You were already like that at 19?

57:55.916 --> 57:56.875
Obsessed?

57:59.375 --> 58:01.250
I believe in seeking out the truth.

58:04.416 --> 58:06.166
Well, a toast to the truth, hm?

58:06.250 --> 58:07.666
Toast to the truth.

58:16.166 --> 58:19.083
I'd forgotten
that life could be this carefree.

58:19.166 --> 58:20.041
Or enticing.

58:21.875 --> 58:23.750
I had forgotten who I used to be.

58:26.583 --> 58:29.250
- Um, I need to use the bathroom.
- Uh, sure.

58:30.166 --> 58:32.375
It's down the hall,
at the end, on the left.

58:33.375 --> 58:34.250
Thanks.

59:01.791 --> 59:03.000
What are you doing here?

59:03.791 --> 59:04.750
Uh…

59:05.625 --> 59:07.458
I think I went to the wrong door.

59:08.416 --> 59:10.125
The bathroom is that way.

59:10.666 --> 59:11.500
Okay.

59:39.875 --> 59:42.958
- Your phone's been ringing off the hook.
- Let me see.

59:43.041 --> 59:45.125
Oh, it's my friend Paty.

59:45.666 --> 59:49.416
We have a safety app where we can see
both of our real-time locations.

59:49.500 --> 59:50.791
Let me tell her I'm fine.

59:51.958 --> 59:55.833
Hey, Paty. I forgot to tell you
that I decided to have dinner at Marco's.

59:56.375 --> 59:57.791
He's treating me well.

59:58.375 --> 01:00:00.750
I just found out his life's a paradox.

01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:03.291
He's obsessed with the truth

01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:06.041
and mysterious at the same time.

01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:10.416
Well, there's no need to worry,

01:00:11.125 --> 01:00:13.041
he doesn't seem like he's dangerous.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.375
Call you later.

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:39.500
It's so hard for me to trust anyone.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.916
To share my feelings.

01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:48.625
I've had to deal with a lot recently.

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:50.666
It's complicated.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.625
It's still a mess.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:58.708
Although with you by my side,

01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:02.791
I feel like I have a new lease on life
and things can get better again.

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:09.083
You always say
that your life is complicated.

01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:16.291
But what is it that's so complicated
that you won't tell me?

01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:20.083
Get out of my way.

01:04:20.166 --> 01:04:23.041
- Don't touch me.
- I'm going to call Mr. Marco.

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.958
I know he's in there.

01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:28.291
- Ms. Paula…
- Keep your hands off me.

01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:31.000
I'm going to call Mr. Marco,
but you have to wait downstairs.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.750
Wait downstairs? You're crazy.
This is my house too.

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:36.666
Paula, what are you doing here?
Would you please leave?

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:40.083
So you're the slut
who's seeing my husband?

01:04:41.625 --> 01:04:42.458
Husband?

01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:45.708
- It's not what you think.
- So you're married?

01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:48.416
Yes, yes, yes. We're married, of course.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.625
We're very married. You had no idea?

01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:54.458
Aw, what a sad little face.

01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:57.875
So, you believed
his sad little story, huh?

01:04:57.958 --> 01:05:01.416
The poor, disillusioned man who's hurt
and needs to be taken care of?

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.458
- Shut up, Paula.
- No, don't tell me to shut up.

01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:06.041
She should know the truth.

01:05:06.125 --> 01:05:08.666
I think she'd wanna know
how much you've hurt me.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.333
How you destroyed my life,

01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:12.875
and abandoned me
just when I needed you the most.

01:05:12.958 --> 01:05:15.833
She should know
what an evil monster you really are.

01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:21.166
I mean, if he did all that to me,
to his own wife,

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.500
I can't imagine what he would do to you.

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:25.958
A meaningless hook-up.

01:05:26.958 --> 01:05:28.583
- Babi…
- Excuse me.

01:05:28.666 --> 01:05:30.375
You had no right.

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:32.541
- Go! Go away. Just leave.
- Babi, wait!

01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:35.000
- Listen to me. I--
- Let me go.

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:38.125
You always seek out the truth, huh?

01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:41.833
It's all smoke and mirrors
to hide what a liar you are.

01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:44.500
Don't ever talk to me again.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.750
Don't come after me.

01:06:40.666 --> 01:06:42.750
Hey there, Sleeping Beauty.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.208
- Hey, girl.
- Want some food?

01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:46.250
Uh-uh.

01:06:46.333 --> 01:06:49.041
Come on, have some soup.

01:06:49.666 --> 01:06:51.250
Hey guys.

01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:54.291
I'm gonna take your parents to eat, okay?

01:06:54.375 --> 01:06:56.250
- Okay.
- What do you think? Let's go.

01:06:56.333 --> 01:06:57.875
- Sure.
- Thanks, Paty.

01:06:57.958 --> 01:07:00.791
- Take care of her.
- You got it.

01:07:05.125 --> 01:07:06.208
Got you bonbons.

01:07:07.041 --> 01:07:09.333
Just what I want.

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:13.250
Hi.

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:16.583
Holy shit.

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:18.500
You scared us, Babi.

01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:20.875
I did, huh?

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:27.375
What matters is that you'll be okay now,
out of danger.

01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:29.000
I hope you're right.

01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:31.833
Oh, Thi, I don't…

01:07:32.875 --> 01:07:34.583
I don't remember all that much…

01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:40.166
but I have this strange feeling,
that car tried to run me off the road.

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:42.416
- Oh purpose?
- Uh-huh.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.666
That's bad. Who'd do that to you?

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:47.000
I have no idea.

01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:49.208
I'm not sure if that really happened, but…

01:07:49.708 --> 01:07:51.250
it was just a gut feeling.

01:07:52.375 --> 01:07:53.333
Although Caio…

01:07:53.916 --> 01:07:54.958
Caio?

01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:57.625
Honestly, I have no clue what to think.

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.250
Hey there.

01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:06.625
I'm happy to see you're okay.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.750
There's nothing we need to talk about.

01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:13.666
That's okay,
we don't have to talk right now.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.708
I just wanted to see you.

01:08:19.458 --> 01:08:20.291
You have.

01:08:25.041 --> 01:08:25.875
Look…

01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:28.166
Babi appreciates

01:08:29.125 --> 01:08:30.166
the flowers,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.500
but she really needs to rest.

01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:35.958
I think you should leave now.

01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:53.833
You okay?

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:55.583
Good.

01:08:55.666 --> 01:08:58.208
Hey, Fernando, it's Marco.
How goes it, man?

01:09:00.125 --> 01:09:03.250
I have a favor
I need to ask you for something.

01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:08.791
I'm gonna need
to check out some traffic footage.

01:09:11.416 --> 01:09:13.416
I also need to put a wiretap on someone.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:25.291
- Hey, honey, you're okay.
- Thanks, mom.

01:09:25.375 --> 01:09:26.875
- You're the best.
- Feeling better?

01:09:26.958 --> 01:09:29.375
- Mm-hmm.
- Now you can get some rest, right?

01:09:29.875 --> 01:09:31.416
And that's it.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.375
Here you go. Careful, it's hot.

01:09:33.458 --> 01:09:34.625
- Thanks.
- Of course.

01:09:34.708 --> 01:09:37.916
It'll be good to get back to the office
and do some work.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.791
- I might swing by the there tomorrow.
- Don't bother.

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:43.666
- Thiago and I have it all covered.
- But I wanna go in.

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.375
There's no reason to stay here.

01:09:45.458 --> 01:09:47.833
I don't want to go in a downward spiral.

01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:51.666
All righty then.
I'm not gonna let that happen on my watch.

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:54.125
If I start to feel crappy,
I swear I'll come back.

01:09:54.208 --> 01:09:55.625
- I promise.
- Yeah, all right.

01:09:57.666 --> 01:09:59.791
Can you get that for me, Mom, please?

01:10:01.958 --> 01:10:04.875
Hello? Hold on a minute, please.

01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:06.583
Uh, Marco is out front.

01:10:08.166 --> 01:10:09.166
Marco?

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:12.416
Hi.

01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:16.666
I know it's probably not a good time, but…

01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:21.375
I wanna explain myself
after what went down.

01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:24.125
More than just explain.

01:10:25.666 --> 01:10:27.750
<i>I'd rather you actually see for yourself.</i>

01:10:35.708 --> 01:10:37.458
Vitória was born with a rare condition.

01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:39.916
<i>Emanuel Syndrome.</i>

01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:45.375
<i>It causes extremely weak muscles.</i>

01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:51.333
<i>She also has some developmental problems.</i>

01:10:55.416 --> 01:10:58.541
<i>A malformation of her intestines,</i>
<i>as well as a heart defect.</i>

01:11:01.875 --> 01:11:04.041
- Paula is Vitória's mother?
- Yeah.

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.166
And you guys are married?

01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:11.250
We were married. Four years.

01:11:12.416 --> 01:11:15.458
At first, we were happy together.

01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:20.041
But even before she-- she got pregnant,

01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:22.833
I'd already been worried
about Paula's mental health.

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:31.000
After she got pregnant, it just got worse.

01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:34.875
<i>I tried everything.</i>

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.708
<i>I took her to doctors, psychiatrists, but…</i>

01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:41.291
<i>she'd quit her treatment</i>
<i>as soon as she started it.</i>

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:47.833
Then Vitória was born,
and we learned about her disability.

01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:52.333
<i>I thought that getting married</i>
<i>and becoming a mother</i>

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.666
would give me a purpose.

01:11:57.541 --> 01:12:00.708
But instead,
it feels like the other way around.

01:12:02.208 --> 01:12:03.250
<i>I've…</i>

01:12:04.208 --> 01:12:06.500
<i>been losing myself little by little.</i>

01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:10.125
There's no end in sight.

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.375
I know it won't end.

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:18.958
<i>But you kept taking care of her?</i>

01:12:19.583 --> 01:12:22.291
Yes, of course.
We stayed together. I tried.

01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:27.416
<i>Until one night</i>
<i>when she came to the hospital…</i>

01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:33.291
Paula took Vitória from her room
and tried to leave with her.

01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:38.041
<i>Vitória can't survive</i>
<i>without the machines.</i>

01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:41.958
Thankfully, I was already there.
I stopped her.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.333
<i>To save my daughter's life,</i>

01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:49.125
<i>I had to file a restraining order</i>
<i>to keep Vitória safe, away from Paula.</i>

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.083
<i>That was the hardest decision of my life.</i>

01:12:53.666 --> 01:12:56.916
That's why that day on the pier
I had to leave, to go handle that.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.166
They called me from the hospital
saying that she was trying to get at her.

01:13:02.666 --> 01:13:03.833
After all that,

01:13:04.708 --> 01:13:08.291
I swore I'd never
get involved with anyone ever again.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.541
But to be honest…

01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:18.958
I have utterly
and completely fallen in love with you.

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:24.750
My divorce with Paula
is about to be finalized.

01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:26.333
Any day now.

01:13:27.791 --> 01:13:29.708
Then I can finally live my life again.

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:34.083
Well then,
I think we should wait then, right?

01:13:35.666 --> 01:13:37.208
I've waited long enough, Babi.

01:13:38.375 --> 01:13:40.083
I know exactly what I want.

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:48.083
Marco, I need some time
to process all of this.

01:13:48.166 --> 01:13:49.916
Um, it's a lot to think about.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.708
And I also have a serious problem
at work to deal with.

01:13:54.416 --> 01:13:55.541
Give me some time.

01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:58.416
Give us some time.

01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:03.000
Sure.

01:14:04.666 --> 01:14:05.625
I'll wait.

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:17.791
Thank you, Fernando.

01:14:18.291 --> 01:14:20.666
<i>You'll know</i>
<i>if there's anything on the wiretap.</i>

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:21.958
- Good man.
- <i>Bye.</i>

01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:25.625
- They found the license plate.
- And?

01:14:26.291 --> 01:14:29.833
It was stolen.
This gets more and more suspicious.

01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:33.125
Maybe it's a random coincidence,
I'm not sure.

01:14:33.958 --> 01:14:36.291
Just to be safe,
Fernando set up a wiretap.

01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:39.416
You can get yourself
in some serious shit for this.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.708
You are a judge.

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:45.125
I really need to know what's going on.
I have to protect Babi.

01:14:56.708 --> 01:14:58.000
Decaf for you.

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:03.208
I'm getting taking care of
when you're the one who needs to recover?

01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:04.958
I'm really glad you're back.

01:15:05.041 --> 01:15:07.791
Yeah, same here.
Hey, let me ask you something.

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:11.333
What's going on with the laptop
we took from Caio?

01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:13.500
Did you give it to the lawyers?
What's the verdict?

01:15:13.583 --> 01:15:15.375
Yeah, I left the laptop with them,

01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:18.500
but this will take some time,
Babi, you know that, right?

01:15:18.583 --> 01:15:22.166
I gave it some thought and I think
we should take it to Marco's office.

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:26.166
But Marco is the judge, Babi.

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:28.833
The one on the case. It's a bad idea.

01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:32.583
Maybe. But he's turning out
to be a really great person,

01:15:32.666 --> 01:15:34.125
and he wants to help us out.

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:36.750
He'd even expedite the whole process.

01:15:38.916 --> 01:15:40.250
Should we do that though?

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:43.375
We can't let Caio get away with it.

01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:44.875
Then that's it.

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.833
Yeah, you're right, let's do it.
I'm with you.

01:15:49.416 --> 01:15:51.291
Off to court, then? We'll go?

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:54.041
I'm gonna stop at my place
to grab the copies of the files.

01:15:54.125 --> 01:15:55.958
- Oh, you made copies?
- Why wouldn't I?

01:15:56.041 --> 01:15:58.333
It's all saved
to a hard disk and the cloud.

01:15:58.416 --> 01:15:59.791
So I'll pick them up.

01:16:01.166 --> 01:16:02.625
Right on, that's smart.

01:16:04.583 --> 01:16:05.791
Uh…

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.625
I still have a few things to handle here,

01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:12.791
but I'll come pick you up at your house
in two hours, does that work?

01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:13.833
Sounds good.

01:16:13.916 --> 01:16:15.875
- All right. Okay.
- See you then.

01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:18.083
The chair?

01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:19.458
I'm aware.

01:17:16.125 --> 01:17:17.291
Hey, Caio.

01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:23.750
What happened to you?

01:17:24.458 --> 01:17:27.750
These guys broke into my house.
I was tortured.

01:17:30.625 --> 01:17:32.750
They're watching everything we do, Thiago.

01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:37.416
They told me that if I don't fix this shit
I should expect the worst.

01:17:40.375 --> 01:17:42.291
You have to tell them this isn't my fault.

01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:45.000
- I didn't give the laptop to Babi.
- It's no use.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.750
What Babi knows incriminates all of us.

01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:51.333
Fuck, I don't wanna be involved
in this shit anymore.

01:17:51.416 --> 01:17:52.458
I want out.

01:17:53.791 --> 01:17:54.875
Let me make this clear.

01:17:56.791 --> 01:17:58.958
If we don't get rid
of Babi and the evidence,

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:01.083
then they'll get rid of us too.

01:18:02.625 --> 01:18:05.833
When you promised I'd get more money
with this construction shit,

01:18:05.916 --> 01:18:08.416
I had no idea we'd end up
working for a crime syndicate.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.958
What'd you fucking expect?

01:18:17.166 --> 01:18:19.666
You acted like you didn't know
where the cash came from,

01:18:20.666 --> 01:18:22.708
but you had no problem spending it all.

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:25.250
A new car, jewelry…

01:18:26.458 --> 01:18:27.541
whiskey,

01:18:27.625 --> 01:18:28.500
women.

01:18:30.083 --> 01:18:33.000
You blew it all away,
so I had to split up you and Babi.

01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:37.625
I did everything I could
to keep her out of it.

01:18:39.333 --> 01:18:40.500
I stalked her,

01:18:41.791 --> 01:18:42.708
<i>threatened her,</i>

01:18:43.583 --> 01:18:46.916
even had someone run her off the road,
but Babi's stubborn.

01:18:48.666 --> 01:18:50.791
And now she's in love with that judge.

01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:54.625
And even with what little brain cells
you have in there,

01:18:54.708 --> 01:18:56.666
you have to realize what that means.

01:18:59.083 --> 01:19:00.000
From now on…

01:19:01.208 --> 01:19:02.541
it's her or us.

01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:05.708
What would you choose?

01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:19.250
Babi's in serious danger.

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:42.041
Hey.

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:43.791
- You got everything?
- I do.

01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:46.958
Got it right here.

01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:49.708
Let's go.

01:20:05.375 --> 01:20:08.041
I'm really glad
we're taking this stuff over to Marco.

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:10.833
I think we are doing the right thing.

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.833
No doubt it is.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:23.791
Thiago, the courthouse is the other way.

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:26.583
Yes, Babi,
you're right, it's the other way.

01:20:27.166 --> 01:20:28.625
So then what route is this?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.041
What's going on?

01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:47.416
What's this?

01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:50.250
You should keep quiet, Babi.

01:20:58.458 --> 01:21:01.291
Ugh. Come on, Babi, answer!

01:21:06.333 --> 01:21:07.208
Don't answer it.

01:21:09.541 --> 01:21:12.291
- I'm in the car with Thiago. He's got a--
- Hang up!

01:21:12.375 --> 01:21:15.625
- Stop! Thiago, you're gonna crash!
- Give me that shit.

01:21:15.708 --> 01:21:17.666
Try me! Shut the fuck up!

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:20.416
Fuck. Fuck!

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.791
Don't ever try that shit again with me!

01:21:27.666 --> 01:21:28.791
<i>Hello? Marco?</i>

01:21:28.875 --> 01:21:31.458
Hello, Paty, thank God.
Babi's in grave danger.

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:33.875
Do you still have that location app?

01:21:33.958 --> 01:21:36.916
<i>- I do, wait just a sec, let me check it.</i>
<i>- </i>Please hurry.

01:21:37.791 --> 01:21:40.166
- Go!
- <i>Here. Here it is.</i>

01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:43.083
<i>She's on Marginal Pinheiros Road</i>
<i>turning on Gwido Caloy Avenue.</i>

01:21:43.166 --> 01:21:44.958
Don't hang up. Stay on the line.

01:21:45.583 --> 01:21:49.541
Thiago, if this is about the evidence,
if you're somehow involved, we can talk.

01:21:49.625 --> 01:21:52.208
You're like my brother,
I'd never hurt you, I swear.

01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:54.041
I don't trust you anymore, Babi.

01:21:54.125 --> 01:21:56.458
Now shut the fuck up
and let me drive, okay?

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:03.375
- Hello? Officer Aguiar?
- <i>Hey, Marco.</i>

01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:06.708
I have evidence that two men are planning
to murder an innocent woman.

01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:08.416
I'm sending you my location.

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.166
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- </i>No time to waste. Hurry.

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:12.958
<i>Look, don't do anything</i>
<i>until the police get there.</i>

01:22:13.041 --> 01:22:14.166
All right.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.875
- Where is she?
- <i>They're going to the reservoir.</i>

01:22:26.958 --> 01:22:28.000
I'm on it.

01:23:01.791 --> 01:23:03.125
Babi, listen closely.

01:23:06.166 --> 01:23:07.500
You'll get out of the car,

01:23:08.375 --> 01:23:09.833
and you'll do whatever I say.

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:11.541
If you try to run…

01:23:12.958 --> 01:23:13.958
if you scream…

01:23:15.416 --> 01:23:17.291
I'll put a bullet hole in your brain.

01:23:20.208 --> 01:23:21.166
Got it?

01:23:43.708 --> 01:23:45.875
Get out of the car, Babi.

01:23:54.583 --> 01:23:57.458
- Fucking move it!
- Please, stop, Thiago. Stop.

01:24:03.875 --> 01:24:06.083
<i>Keep going,</i>
<i>then take the next right.</i>

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.750
<i>Marco, save Babi.</i>

01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:18.416
Thiago, you don't have to do this.

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:24.041
I'll pretend I don't know anything,
and I didn't say a word to Marco.

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:24.958
Walk.

01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:29.333
I saw the statements that were forged,

01:24:29.416 --> 01:24:32.541
I saw the fake receipts,
there's no way you'd be incriminated.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.166
I can help you out.

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.250
Let me help you get out of this.

01:24:39.333 --> 01:24:41.958
I want revenge on Caio,
I have nothing against you.

01:24:42.041 --> 01:24:43.875
You're my best friend, Thiago.

01:24:45.916 --> 01:24:49.291
You didn't mean to do it.
You got caught in Caio's lies like I did.

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:50.291
Shut up!

01:24:51.083 --> 01:24:52.541
Shut the fuck up right now.

01:24:53.375 --> 01:24:56.000
Shut up, you don't know shit at all, okay?

01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:14.166
No.

01:25:14.250 --> 01:25:15.250
No.

01:25:25.416 --> 01:25:26.333
Hold this.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:32.875
No.

01:25:34.791 --> 01:25:36.125
Get in the grave.

01:25:36.916 --> 01:25:38.125
Get in the grave.

01:25:46.833 --> 01:25:48.791
Why are you both doing this to me?

01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:52.250
I just wanted to have more cash.

01:25:52.833 --> 01:25:55.166
And Caio just wanted to fuck other women.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:57.625
But you had to stick your nose
where it didn't belong.

01:25:58.625 --> 01:26:01.208
If I don't get rid of you,
they'll kill me.

01:26:01.875 --> 01:26:03.250
That's why you have to die.

01:26:03.333 --> 01:26:05.875
No.

01:26:09.875 --> 01:26:10.875
You do it.

01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:13.333
Fuck, Thiago.

01:26:13.416 --> 01:26:16.250
You're the one who wanted in.

01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:20.333
That's how it goes. If you know too much,
they'll put you in the ground.

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.375
I need to know you've got my back on this.

01:26:25.666 --> 01:26:26.791
It's her or us.

01:26:31.541 --> 01:26:32.541
Don't do this.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:36.333
Don't do it, don't do it.
Don't do it, Caio. Look at me.

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:40.250
- I love you.
- Kill her.

01:26:40.958 --> 01:26:42.916
Look at me, Caio.

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:45.708
Shoot her fucking now!

01:26:48.291 --> 01:26:49.833
Fuck, I can't do it, Thiago.

01:26:50.416 --> 01:26:52.375
- Are you crazy?
- I can't do it.

01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:54.041
- They're gonna kill us!
- Fuck you! No!

01:27:09.125 --> 01:27:11.083
No, wait.

01:27:12.041 --> 01:27:13.125
No, wait. Thia--

01:27:14.416 --> 01:27:16.333
What have you done?

01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:17.666
Oh, Caio!

01:27:22.291 --> 01:27:23.583
What have I done?

01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:26.416
Look what you made me do, God damn it!

01:27:29.666 --> 01:27:31.541
You fucking bastard!

01:27:32.125 --> 01:27:33.250
Marco!

01:27:47.958 --> 01:27:50.041
Marco!

01:27:50.916 --> 01:27:53.000
Marco!

01:28:02.333 --> 01:28:05.000
Calm down. I'm putting it down,
I'm putting it down.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:12.958
It's over, Babi.

01:28:27.791 --> 01:28:29.041
Look at me.

01:28:29.125 --> 01:28:30.750
Stay with me. I've got you.

01:28:36.416 --> 01:28:39.500
<i>Two men have been arrested</i>
<i>after trying to kill a woman</i>

01:28:39.583 --> 01:28:41.458
<i>last night in the South of São Paulo.</i>

01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:44.250
<i>The suspects,</i>
<i>Caio Siqueira and Thiago Freitas,</i>

01:28:44.333 --> 01:28:46.583
<i>were involved in a money laundering scheme</i>

01:28:46.666 --> 01:28:49.625
<i>and were arrested</i>
<i>after being found out by Bárbara Vieira,</i>

01:28:49.708 --> 01:28:52.250
<i>who was Thiago's partner</i>
<i>at their accounting firm.</i>

01:28:52.333 --> 01:28:55.666
<i>Caio and Thiago planned to murder Bárbara</i>
<i>but were stopped…</i>

01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:56.958
It'll be all right.

01:28:57.041 --> 01:28:59.375
<i>…the judge presiding over their case.</i>

01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:05.541
AMBULANCE

01:29:10.875 --> 01:29:13.291
SIX MONTHS LATER

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:26.083
<i>The doctors are thrilled.</i>

01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:29.666
She's gets discharged this week,
and finally comes back.

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:31.458
Great, Marco.

01:29:32.375 --> 01:29:35.541
I think Vitória is really lucky
to be your daughter.

01:29:35.625 --> 01:29:38.416
I'm the lucky one to be her dad.

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:40.500
Oh, it's Paty.

01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:46.125
Hey, my friend! How's my jetsetter doing?
What's the hotel like?

01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:49.083
<i>I'm loving it so much.</i>
<i>Your suggestion was worth it.</i>

01:29:49.166 --> 01:29:51.791
Although listen, yo,
I've got a bomb to drop on you.

01:29:51.875 --> 01:29:55.541
- I didn't tell you before I left because--
- Tell me. I hate mysteries.

01:29:55.625 --> 01:29:58.375
After so many years
of being down in the gutter,

01:29:58.458 --> 01:30:02.208
<i>making out with all of São Paulo,</i>
<i>I'm finally settling down.</i>

01:30:02.291 --> 01:30:03.250
You're joking.

01:30:03.333 --> 01:30:05.125
I'm in a relationship.

01:30:05.208 --> 01:30:07.583
You're in a relationship?
Is this for real?

01:30:07.666 --> 01:30:09.333
<i>- What, you don't believe me?</i>
<i>- </i>No.

01:30:09.416 --> 01:30:12.208
<i>Babe, look. Remember this guy?</i>

01:30:12.291 --> 01:30:14.166
<i>- Ah, hey! How's it going?</i>
<i>- Mmm.</i>

01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.500
The guy from you-know-who's office?
You're kidding!

01:30:17.583 --> 01:30:20.666
<i>Hi, how are you? It's been a while.</i>

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:23.250
Oh, for real girl, we're so happy.
All three of us.

01:30:23.833 --> 01:30:24.708
What's that?

01:30:24.791 --> 01:30:28.916
<i>The three of us. Me, Júnior, and Rodrigo.</i>

01:30:30.583 --> 01:30:32.166
All right, well, once again

01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:35.333
I'm at a loss for words
when it comes to your escapades.

01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:37.708
We'll talk later.
I just wanted to tell you the news.

01:30:37.791 --> 01:30:39.333
I have so much to do.

01:30:39.416 --> 01:30:42.166
Well, cool, I hope you're all very happy!
