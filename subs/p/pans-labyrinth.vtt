00:42.142 --> 00:48.513
<i>Spain, 1944</i>

00:49.716 --> 00:51.084
<i>The Civil War is over.</i>

00:51.084 --> 00:53.219
<i>Hidden in the mountains,</i>

00:53.219 --> 00:55.422
<i>armed men are still fighting</i>
<i>the new Fascist regime.</i>

00:55.422 --> 00:57.686
<i>Military posts are established</i>
<i>to exterminate the Resistance.</i>

01:20.780 --> 01:24.580
A long time ago,

01:26.820 --> 01:31.621
in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,

01:32.692 --> 01:36.685
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

01:38.698 --> 01:43.897
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.202
One day,

01:50.944 --> 01:54.573
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.478
Once outside...

02:02.956 --> 02:06.585
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.

02:09.529 --> 02:12.726
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

02:13.199 --> 02:19.434
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.003
However, her father, the king,

02:23.309 --> 02:26.335
always knew that the Princess' soul
would return,

02:26.846 --> 02:28.313
perhaps in another body,

02:28.982 --> 02:31.507
in another place, at another time.

02:31.918 --> 02:35.445
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

02:35.788 --> 02:39.087
until the world stopped turning.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.458
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

02:50.637 --> 02:53.231
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.406
Fairy tales?

03:00.813 --> 03:04.909
You're a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

03:07.987 --> 03:09.887
Ask him to stop the car.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.870
Ofelia, wait.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.166
Your brother's not well.

03:32.345 --> 03:33.937
Madam, are you okay?

04:40.780 --> 04:41.747
Ofelia?

04:44.150 --> 04:47.051
Ofelia, Come here.

04:50.256 --> 04:53.487
-l saw a fairy.
-Just look at your shoes!

04:54.727 --> 04:55.716
Let's go.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.764
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.830
l want you to call him Father.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.702
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

05:06.105 --> 05:09.404
lt's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

05:35.335 --> 05:37.064
They're coming, Captain.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.561
15 minutes late.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.683
Carmen.

06:06.165 --> 06:07.462
Welcome.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.705
That's not necessary.
l can walk perfectly well.

06:15.174 --> 06:17.642
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.208
No.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.249
Come.
Do it for me.

06:29.489 --> 06:30.513
Thank you.

06:32.425 --> 06:33.551
Ofelia, come out.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.654
Say hello to the Captain.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.757
Ofelia.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.104
lt's the other hand, Ofelia.

06:56.048 --> 06:57.072
Mercedes!

06:58.351 --> 07:01.184
-Bring the luggage.
-Sir.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.444
lt's a labyrinth.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.516
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.819
Even before the mill.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.831
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

08:21.467 --> 08:22.661
Thank you.

08:23.202 --> 08:24.533
Have you read them all?

08:25.037 --> 08:25.969
Mercedes!

08:28.074 --> 08:29.063
The Captain is calling.

08:31.611 --> 08:32.736
Your father needs me.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.807
He's not my father.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.241
The Captain is not my father.

08:39.418 --> 08:42.751
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.220
He's not my father.

08:45.591 --> 08:48.059
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

08:48.895 --> 08:50.556
Have you seen my mother?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.622
-lsn't she beautiful!
-Yes.

08:53.065 --> 08:55.431
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.083
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods

09:15.388 --> 09:17.185
because it's hard
to track them up there.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.655
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.487
We'll block all access
to the woods

09:23.863 --> 09:26.923
Food, medicine-
we'll store it all. Right here.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.000
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.065
We'll set up three
new command posts.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.833
Here, here and here.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.032
Mercedes.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.836
-Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
-Yes, sir.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.645
This will help you sleep
through the night.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.446
Just two drops just before bed.

09:54.694 --> 09:55.786
Two drops only.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.161
Very good.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.330
All of it.
Good.

10:05.838 --> 10:09.296
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.941
You or your nurse.

10:14.747 --> 10:15.736
Good night.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.281
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.426
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.897
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.838
This is all l could get.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.064
l'm sorry.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.970
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.473
Come here, Ofelia.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.918
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

11:40.900 --> 11:41.924
Are you afraid?

11:44.136 --> 11:45.160
A little.

11:50.242 --> 11:51.368
What's that noise?

11:51.477 --> 11:54.571
Nothing, just the wind.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.245
Nights here are different
from city nights.

12:00.186 --> 12:03.212
There, you hear cars-tramway.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.621
Here the houses are old.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.382
They creak.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.328
As if they were speaking.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.802
Tomorrow, l'm going
to give you a surprise.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.164
-A surprise?
-Yes.

12:22.708 --> 12:27.145
-A book?
-No, something much better.

12:33.119 --> 12:35.087
Why did you have to get married?

12:39.325 --> 12:41.657
l was alone too long.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.389
l'm with you.
You weren't alone.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.922
You were never alone.

12:50.402 --> 12:54.133
When you're older, you'll understand.
lt hasn't been easy for me either.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.711
Your brother's at it again-

13:00.579 --> 13:02.706
Tell him one of your stories.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.944
l'm sure that'll calm down.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.412
My brother, my brother...

13:16.562 --> 13:19.030
Many, many years ago,

13:19.398 --> 13:21.764
in a sad, faraway land,

13:21.867 --> 13:25.598
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.933
At sunset,

13:28.607 --> 13:30.871
on top of that mountain,

13:31.110 --> 13:35.547
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

13:35.881 --> 13:39.317
But no one dared go near it

13:39.785 --> 13:42.948
because its thorns were full of poison.

13:52.264 --> 13:56.758
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

13:56.836 --> 14:01.466
and pain, but never about the promise
of eternal life.

14:05.511 --> 14:13.384
And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

14:15.254 --> 14:19.850
forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

14:20.492 --> 14:23.586
forever alone, until the end of time.

14:36.508 --> 14:37.440
Come in.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.743
-How is she?
-Very weak.

14:43.349 --> 14:44.714
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.009
l'll sleep down here.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.680
-And my son?
-Pardon?

14:52.992 --> 14:54.823
Excuse us, Captain.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.921
My son, how is he?

14:59.698 --> 15:01.598
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

15:03.802 --> 15:04.700
Very good.

15:06.639 --> 15:11.599
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

15:14.780 --> 15:18.546
-ls that your opinion?
-My professional opinion, yes, sir.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.154
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.681
That's all.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.626
One more thing, Captain.

15:30.629 --> 15:32.654
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

15:34.967 --> 15:35.934
Don't fuck with me.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.398
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

15:41.140 --> 15:41.902
Gunfire.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.204
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.912
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.383
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.511
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.185
We found this weapon on him.
lt's been fired.

16:00.392 --> 16:02.087
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.719
Again, keep quiet.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.067
"No God, no country, no Master"?

16:16.542 --> 16:20.672
-Just like that-how do you like that?
-Red prpaganda, Captain.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.610
lt's not propaganda, sir.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.613
lt's an old almanac, Captain.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.313
We're just farmers.

16:29.922 --> 16:30.752
Go on.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.757
l went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.522
For my daughters. They're sick.

16:40.132 --> 16:41.599
Rabbits, uh?

16:42.001 --> 16:45.801
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.877
Leave him alone.

17:01.820 --> 17:05.085
You killed him,
You killed him!

17:05.590 --> 17:08.583
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

17:38.357 --> 17:40.518
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

17:40.793 --> 17:42.351
before you come bothering me.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.788
Yes, Captain.

18:04.049 --> 18:07.485
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

18:07.986 --> 18:11.251
Mother, there's something in the room.

18:52.664 --> 18:53.596
Hello.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.990
Did you follow me here?

18:56.768 --> 18:57.928
Are you a fairy?

19:00.405 --> 19:01.269
Look!

19:06.612 --> 19:08.102
This is a fairy.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.569
You want me to go with you?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.612
Outside? Where?

20:59.625 --> 21:01.286
Hello?

21:02.661 --> 21:04.185
Hello?

21:22.247 --> 21:24.340
Echo.

21:31.356 --> 21:33.381
Echo.

21:36.261 --> 21:38.354
Hello?

21:41.199 --> 21:42.723
Hello?

21:45.337 --> 21:46.634
lt's you.

21:51.777 --> 21:55.110
lt's you.
You've returned.

21:55.213 --> 21:57.238
Don't be frightened,
l beg you.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.517
Look, look.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.422
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

22:11.563 --> 22:12.723
Me?

22:15.300 --> 22:17.768
l've had so many names...

22:17.969 --> 22:25.967
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

22:26.144 --> 22:32.982
l am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.082
l am...

22:38.557 --> 22:41.355
l am a faun.

22:42.127 --> 22:46.154
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

22:46.298 --> 22:49.927
-No, l'm...
-You're Princess Moanna,

22:50.035 --> 22:55.701
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.503
My father was a tailor.

22:57.609 --> 22:59.736
You are not born of man.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.213
lt was the moon that bore you.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.680
Look on your left shoulder

23:05.851 --> 23:08.820
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

23:09.254 --> 23:19.220
your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

23:19.698 --> 23:21.359
This is...

23:22.000 --> 23:24.594
This is the last of them.

23:25.237 --> 23:33.838
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,

23:34.346 --> 23:38.476
that you have not become a mortal.

23:42.053 --> 23:47.685
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

23:50.629 --> 23:56.659
This is The Book of Crossroads.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.497
Open it, when you are alone

24:00.639 --> 24:03.540
and it will show you your future,

24:03.642 --> 24:07.976
show you what must be done.

24:16.354 --> 24:17.912
But there's nothing in here.

25:14.880 --> 25:18.441
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.476
They are too young.

25:21.987 --> 25:25.047
-Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
-Yes, sir.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.518
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.803
You should keep an eye on it.

25:43.608 --> 25:45.041
As you wish, sir.

25:51.583 --> 25:52.572
Cook these.

25:54.352 --> 25:56.820
-He didn't like the coffee.
-He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

25:56.955 --> 25:57.856
A fussy dandy!

25:57.856 --> 26:00.158
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

26:00.158 --> 26:03.992
-Where are we supposed to find that?
-The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.054
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.727
-And they don't shut up.
-Not even underwater.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.710
l'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

26:33.825 --> 26:35.087
Ofelia.

26:37.662 --> 26:40.392
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

26:40.799 --> 26:43.632
Look what l've made for you.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.264
Do you like it?

26:48.073 --> 26:51.065
What l wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

26:51.209 --> 26:53.643
as fine as this when l was your age!

26:53.812 --> 26:54.938
And look at the shoes!

26:56.314 --> 26:59.010
-Do you like them?
-Yes, very pretty.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.313
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.674
Ofelia?

28:09.454 --> 28:10.318
Ofelia?

28:11.756 --> 28:15.214
Hurry up.
l want to see the dress on you.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.053
l want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

28:20.899 --> 28:22.662
You'll look like a princess.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.471
A princess?

28:34.813 --> 28:36.542
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

28:36.648 --> 28:39.116
And don't forget the beans.

28:42.353 --> 28:46.722
-You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
-What a gorgeous dress!

28:49.160 --> 28:51.651
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

28:54.466 --> 28:55.933
Do you want some milk with honey?

29:01.473 --> 29:05.432
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

29:07.812 --> 29:11.748
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

29:12.884 --> 29:13.782
No.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.951
But when l was a little girl,
l did.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.614
l believed in a lot of things
l don't believe any more.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.754
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.820
Really?

29:26.064 --> 29:29.200
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,

29:29.200 --> 29:30.895
-And a faun, too.
-A faun?

29:31.169 --> 29:35.128
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

29:36.174 --> 29:39.200
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.502
Mercedes!

29:42.447 --> 29:43.414
Come with me.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.889
Captain,
everything is here.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.823
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

29:58.997 --> 30:02.125
olives, bacon.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.099
This-this is real tobacco.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.469
And the ration cards.

30:07.839 --> 30:10.171
-l need you to check the inventory.
-Very well.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.669
Mercedes.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.575
-The key.
-Yes, sir.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.857
-ls this the only copy?
-The only one.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.755
From now on, l'll carry it.

30:29.694 --> 30:30.626
Captain.

30:36.401 --> 30:37.993
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

30:46.411 --> 30:47.400
lt's them.

30:59.090 --> 31:03.151
"Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,

31:03.728 --> 31:09.360
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."

31:16.174 --> 31:18.506
"They protected one another,

31:18.810 --> 31:21.973
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

31:22.413 --> 31:24.847
that grew on a hill, near the mill."

31:27.385 --> 31:29.148
"But now, the tree is dying.

31:29.487 --> 31:33.150
lts branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

31:33.958 --> 31:37.189
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

31:37.462 --> 31:38.929
and won't let the tree thrive.

31:40.231 --> 31:43.428
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth

31:44.102 --> 31:47.560
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

31:48.172 --> 31:51.335
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."

33:17.862 --> 33:19.659
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.296
They left in a hurry.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.340
A dozen men, at most.

33:50.261 --> 33:51.626
Antibiotics.

33:52.597 --> 33:55.760
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

33:58.102 --> 33:59.296
They're here.

34:02.273 --> 34:04.639
Those sons of bitches are here.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.637
and they're watching us.

34:17.588 --> 34:19.283
Hey!

34:20.625 --> 34:23.116
You left this behind!

34:23.860 --> 34:25.851
And your lottery ticket!

34:26.397 --> 34:28.489
Why don't you come back
and get it?

34:29.233 --> 34:31.701
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

35:42.840 --> 35:46.401
Hello.
l'm Princess Moanna,

35:46.777 --> 35:48.244
and l'm not afraid of you.

35:51.716 --> 35:54.947
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

35:55.153 --> 35:57.178
eating all these bugs...

35:57.955 --> 36:00.890
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

38:43.788 --> 38:45.813
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

38:45.956 --> 38:47.218
Yes, ma'am.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.420
Have you checked the garden?

38:52.763 --> 38:54.560
-And the barn?
-Yes, ma'am.

38:55.399 --> 38:56.991
Where is that girl?

38:57.068 --> 38:58.365
This way, please.

38:59.403 --> 39:02.395
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

39:04.275 --> 39:06.140
-Charmed.
-A pleasure to meet you.

39:06.744 --> 39:10.043
From now on,
one ration card per family.

39:10.815 --> 39:11.782
Take a look.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.111
-One?
-Only one.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.682
Captain, l'm not sure
it'll be enough.

39:16.754 --> 39:18.085
lf people are careful,
it should be plenty.

39:18.155 --> 39:21.352
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

39:21.492 --> 39:25.360
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

39:26.230 --> 39:28.966
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

39:28.966 --> 39:31.696
We almost got them.
We found this.

39:32.503 --> 39:33.731
Antibiotics.

39:34.972 --> 39:37.338
God has already
saved their souls.

39:37.608 --> 39:40.236
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

39:40.411 --> 39:42.902
We'll help however we can, Captain.

39:43.013 --> 39:45.174
We know you're not here by choice.

39:49.553 --> 39:50.611
You're wrong about that.

39:51.822 --> 39:55.690
l choose to be here because l want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.754
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

40:00.030 --> 40:01.588
that we're all equal.

40:02.199 --> 40:03.666
But there's a big difference:

40:04.268 --> 40:06.793
the war is over and we won.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.340
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

40:11.342 --> 40:13.503
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.269
We're all here by choice.

40:17.281 --> 40:19.476
By choice!

40:22.386 --> 40:25.184
Put the coffee on.
l'm going for more wood.

40:25.322 --> 40:27.313
We'll take care of it.

40:54.318 --> 40:55.444
Ofelia?

41:07.465 --> 41:10.332
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

41:12.770 --> 41:15.568
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

41:15.706 --> 41:16.673
Oh, l see...

41:17.208 --> 41:21.406
And after he died,
l went to work at the shop.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.740
A little more than a year ago,

41:24.648 --> 41:28.448
the Captain and l met again.

41:28.619 --> 41:30.109
Curious, isn't it!

41:30.387 --> 41:33.356
l mean, finding each other again?

41:34.892 --> 41:37.554
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

41:37.828 --> 41:41.525
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

41:42.032 --> 41:44.262
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

41:45.436 --> 41:46.960
We understand.

41:49.373 --> 41:51.534
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

41:52.276 --> 41:53.675
Excuse me.

42:04.622 --> 42:06.817
Have l told you that l was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

42:07.992 --> 42:09.459
No.
l had no idea.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.686
ln Morocco.

42:14.098 --> 42:17.067
l knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

42:17.134 --> 42:18.328
An excellent soldier.

42:18.802 --> 42:23.102
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,

42:23.908 --> 42:25.569
he smashed his watch on a rock

42:25.776 --> 42:28.267
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.712
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

42:34.785 --> 42:37.310
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

42:38.923 --> 42:42.120
What you've done hurts me.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.255
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

42:48.265 --> 42:49.357
Are you listening?

42:52.836 --> 42:55.600
Sometimes l think
you'll never learn to behave.

42:56.473 --> 42:58.464
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

43:00.544 --> 43:01.943
And your father, too.

43:03.414 --> 43:04.676
You mean the Captain?

43:05.816 --> 43:07.113
Him more than me.

43:22.566 --> 43:23.999
l've got the key.

43:27.738 --> 43:29.365
Take me to the Labyrinth.

44:22.626 --> 44:23.615
Hello.

44:25.429 --> 44:27.226
l got the key out.

44:28.298 --> 44:33.167
That's me,
and the girl is you.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.698
And the baby?

44:36.073 --> 44:38.303
So... you retrieved the key.

44:41.078 --> 44:42.340
l'm glad.

44:50.988 --> 44:55.288
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

44:55.659 --> 44:58.355
She's so glad you succeeded.

45:04.401 --> 45:05.800
Keep the key.

45:06.236 --> 45:09.399
You'll be needing it very soon.

45:09.573 --> 45:14.476
And this too?
a piece of chalk.

45:15.913 --> 45:19.183
Two tasks remain

45:19.183 --> 45:24.018
and the moon is almost full.

45:24.121 --> 45:25.918
Be patient.

45:26.190 --> 45:34.894
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

45:34.998 --> 45:37.523
How do l know
that what you say is true?

45:37.835 --> 45:43.774
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

46:05.896 --> 46:07.090
Proceed.

46:08.132 --> 46:10.566
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

46:10.801 --> 46:13.361
Let's go.
Your name?

46:17.107 --> 46:18.597
Your names, first and last.

46:19.076 --> 46:23.240
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.980
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,

46:29.219 --> 46:33.315
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

46:33.690 --> 46:35.351
because in a united Spain,

46:35.526 --> 46:39.223
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

46:53.443 --> 46:57.004
Come on, show me
what happens now?

46:57.514 --> 46:58.538
Show me.

47:36.587 --> 47:38.179
Ofelia, help me...

47:44.027 --> 47:45.892
Captain! Captain!

47:48.465 --> 47:50.023
Come quickly.

47:50.567 --> 47:51.864
... because in a united Spain,

47:51.969 --> 47:55.837
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

47:56.306 --> 47:58.638
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

48:01.545 --> 48:04.514
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

48:06.383 --> 48:09.284
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

48:11.521 --> 48:13.853
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

48:15.626 --> 48:17.685
l'll stay here until the birth.

48:18.161 --> 48:19.128
Make her well.

48:20.464 --> 48:22.489
l don't care what it costs
or what you need.

48:27.204 --> 48:27.898
Make her well.

48:49.226 --> 48:50.693
Don't worry.

48:51.862 --> 48:54.353
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

48:57.734 --> 48:59.361
Having a baby is complicated.

49:00.170 --> 49:03.333
Then l'll never have one.

49:15.886 --> 49:18.719
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

49:30.367 --> 49:31.698
Have you told anyone?

49:33.270 --> 49:34.396
No, l haven't.

49:36.606 --> 49:38.699
l don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

49:49.619 --> 49:50.881
Nor l to you.

49:52.422 --> 49:54.549
Do you know a lullaby?

49:56.526 --> 49:57.754
Only one...

49:58.895 --> 50:00.920
but l don't remember the words.

50:01.231 --> 50:04.826
l don't care.
l still want to hear it.

50:58.188 --> 51:00.952
Don't be afraid.
lt's only me.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.868
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

51:13.036 --> 51:14.162
Then let's go.

51:19.176 --> 51:20.643
This is sheer madness.

51:21.011 --> 51:23.445
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

51:23.947 --> 51:27.075
-Have you thought about that?
-Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

51:27.484 --> 51:29.452
lt's not fear...

51:30.053 --> 51:31.418
at least not for myself.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.599
Pedro!

51:44.901 --> 51:47.335
Pedro, My brother!

52:03.987 --> 52:06.148
You didn't carry out the task.

52:06.289 --> 52:09.588
No, my mother is sick.

52:11.128 --> 52:13.722
That's no excuse
for negligence.

52:13.997 --> 52:18.866
Look...
this is a mandrake root.

52:18.969 --> 52:22.837
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

52:23.773 --> 52:28.437
Put it under your mother's bed

52:28.812 --> 52:32.043
in a bowl of fresh milk.

52:32.649 --> 52:37.609
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

52:38.054 --> 52:42.115
Now, we have no time
to waste.

52:42.425 --> 52:45.189
The full moon will be upon us.

52:47.564 --> 52:50.032
Take my pets
to guide you through.

52:50.634 --> 52:56.231
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

52:56.439 --> 52:59.203
The thing that slumbers there,

53:00.110 --> 53:02.635
it is not human.

53:06.483 --> 53:10.749
You will see
a sumptuous feast,

53:10.854 --> 53:13.652
but don't eat
or drink anything.

53:13.857 --> 53:18.590
Absolutely nothing.

53:20.263 --> 53:23.790
Your life depends on it.

53:44.454 --> 53:49.414
l've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

53:50.126 --> 53:52.492
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

53:54.564 --> 53:56.532
Let's see how that leg's doing,
Frenchie.

53:57.100 --> 54:00.536
How do you think it's doing?
lt's fucked up.

54:01.004 --> 54:02.596
Let's see.

54:05.675 --> 54:08.940
... N-North American,

54:10.313 --> 54:12.975
British and Canadian troops

54:13.083 --> 54:16.610
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

54:17.454 --> 54:20.150
-"France", idiot.
-F-f-f-rance.

54:20.557 --> 54:23.048
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

54:23.293 --> 54:28.094
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

54:28.298 --> 54:31.267
ls it really bad, doctor?

54:32.302 --> 54:33.929
Look, Frenchie.

54:35.205 --> 54:36.763
There's no way to save it.

54:48.652 --> 54:51.951
l'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

54:59.729 --> 55:03.130
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

55:38.336 --> 55:44.502
"Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."

55:49.681 --> 55:53.640
"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."

55:55.954 --> 55:58.081
"Let the fairies guide you."

56:03.462 --> 56:06.795
"Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay,

56:06.155 --> 56:10.717
and come back
before the last grain of sand falls.

58:19.688 --> 58:20.712
No...

58:23.559 --> 58:24.753
This other one.

01:01:00.649 --> 01:01:02.276
No! No!

01:02:18.093 --> 01:02:19.993
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

01:02:20.429 --> 01:02:24.331
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.858
And then what?

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:32.267
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

01:02:32.841 --> 01:02:36.072
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

01:02:36.178 --> 01:02:40.410
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

01:02:40.649 --> 01:02:42.378
lf you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

01:02:42.451 --> 01:02:44.885
-This is a lost cause.
-l'm staying here, doctor.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:46.187
There's no choice.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:02:59.760
You have to leave.

01:03:01.536 --> 01:03:04.471
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.970
lt's exactly what he expects.

01:03:10.145 --> 01:03:11.112
Leave it to me.

01:03:15.183 --> 01:03:16.309
l'm a coward.

01:03:17.419 --> 01:03:19.944
No, you're not.

01:03:21.123 --> 01:03:22.351
Yes, l am.

01:03:22.991 --> 01:03:27.428
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch,

01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:31.528
doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

01:03:35.237 --> 01:03:37.728
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

01:03:42.044 --> 01:03:44.274
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

01:05:39.161 --> 01:05:40.128
Captain Vidal...

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:44.755
Her temperature's down.
l don't know how, but it is.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:46.499
But she still has a fever?

01:05:47.135 --> 01:05:50.036
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.807
Listen to me.

01:05:53.475 --> 01:05:56.501
lf you have to choose,
save the baby.

01:05:56.678 --> 01:05:59.203
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

01:05:59.347 --> 01:06:00.336
Save him.

01:06:36.351 --> 01:06:37.318
Brother...

01:06:39.321 --> 01:06:40.253
Little brother...

01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:44.014
lf you can hear me,

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:47.287
things out here aren't too good.

01:06:49.164 --> 01:06:51.155
But soon you'll have to come out.

01:06:52.434 --> 01:06:54.061
You've made Mama very sick.

01:06:56.271 --> 01:06:59.900
l want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

01:07:01.042 --> 01:07:02.168
just one:

01:07:03.511 --> 01:07:05.172
don't hurt her.

01:07:06.381 --> 01:07:09.612
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty,

01:07:10.452 --> 01:07:12.716
even though sometimes she's sad
for days at a time.

01:07:13.822 --> 01:07:15.687
You'll see, when she smiles,

01:07:17.292 --> 01:07:18.782
you'll love her.

01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:24.461
Listen, if you do what l say,

01:07:24.766 --> 01:07:26.324
l'll make you a promise,

01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:30.898
l'll take you to my kingdom,
and l'll make you a prince.

01:07:31.906 --> 01:07:35.069
l promise you, a prince.

01:08:01.736 --> 01:08:04.261
l sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

01:08:04.472 --> 01:08:06.872
l tried to stop, but it was too late.

01:08:06.941 --> 01:08:09.375
The fireman and l
jumped outjust in time,

01:08:09.611 --> 01:08:11.010
but look at the mess they made.

01:08:14.182 --> 01:08:15.911
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:18.215
They didn't open a single one.

01:08:18.486 --> 01:08:19.919
What the hell are you talking about?

01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:22.353
This whole mess...
They didn't open any of the cars.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:26.857
-They didn't take anything.
-Nothing? Are you sure?

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:31.095
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

01:08:47.948 --> 01:08:49.712
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

01:08:53.054 --> 01:08:56.216
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

01:09:00.929 --> 01:09:03.727
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

01:09:03.965 --> 01:09:05.557
They took cover up on the hill.

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:45.129
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.044
Serrano!

01:10:47.268 --> 01:10:50.294
Let me see.

01:10:55.043 --> 01:10:56.135
Can you talk?

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:01.515
Damn it!

01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:22.695
These are useless! They can't talk.

01:11:32.013 --> 01:11:34.675
Captain,
this one's still alive.

01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:40.118
Shot in the leg.

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.425
-What's happened?
-They caught one.

01:11:47.529 --> 01:11:49.895
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

01:11:55.103 --> 01:11:56.229
Mercedes!

01:11:57.071 --> 01:11:59.301
Pedro... Pedro...

01:12:16.758 --> 01:12:17.725
Mercedes?

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.652
-l need to get into the storeroom.
-Not now.

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:23.494
Move away!

01:12:50.592 --> 01:12:52.822
That's plenty, dear.

01:12:56.397 --> 01:12:57.887
Should l take this up?

01:13:17.752 --> 01:13:20.220
Here, half the dose.

01:13:20.722 --> 01:13:22.519
l don't think l need it.

01:13:22.824 --> 01:13:25.816
l feel better, much better.

01:13:26.094 --> 01:13:28.494
l don't understand.
But l'm glad.

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:32.424
Mother...

01:13:47.181 --> 01:13:49.945
Damn, this cigarette is good!

01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:54.119
Real tobacco hard to find.

01:13:55.757 --> 01:13:58.157
G-G-Go to hell.

01:14:00.828 --> 01:14:04.821
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

01:14:05.099 --> 01:14:07.226
We'll be here all night.

01:14:07.435 --> 01:14:09.403
As long as he talks.

01:14:15.276 --> 01:14:17.107
Garces is right.

01:14:17.945 --> 01:14:20.243
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

01:14:20.948 --> 01:14:24.315
But to make sure it happens,
l brought along a few tools.

01:14:26.654 --> 01:14:28.849
Just things you pick up
along the way.

01:14:29.057 --> 01:14:31.491
At first, l won't be able to trust you,

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:35.518
but after l use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

01:14:37.565 --> 01:14:39.032
When we get to these,

01:14:40.068 --> 01:14:43.731
we'll have developed...
how can l put this-?

01:14:44.138 --> 01:14:46.732
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

01:14:48.176 --> 01:14:49.700
You'll see.

01:14:51.713 --> 01:14:53.374
And when we get to this one,

01:14:54.749 --> 01:14:57.183
l'll believe anything you tell me.

01:15:09.497 --> 01:15:10.794
l'll make you a deal.

01:15:10.865 --> 01:15:14.392
lf you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,

01:15:14.736 --> 01:15:15.930
you can go.

01:15:18.106 --> 01:15:21.041
Don't look at him, look at me.

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:23.072
Above me, there's no one.

01:15:23.611 --> 01:15:25.511
-Garces!
-Yes, Captain?

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:29.307
lf l say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

01:15:29.383 --> 01:15:31.010
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

01:15:31.753 --> 01:15:35.883
There you have it.
Count to three.

01:15:52.273 --> 01:15:54.901
-One.
-Good.

01:15:59.147 --> 01:16:00.114
Two.

01:16:01.883 --> 01:16:04.784
One more and you will be free.

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:22.669
Shame.

01:16:34.582 --> 01:16:38.609
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:46.118
Surely, you must be relieved.

01:16:46.627 --> 01:16:48.720
Yes, thank you.

01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:52.588
But things haven't turned out so well.

01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:54.593
No?

01:16:56.404 --> 01:17:00.033
-l had an accident.
-An accident?

01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:01.175
Yes.

01:17:10.451 --> 01:17:13.352
-You broke the rules!
-lt was only two grapes!

01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:15.046
l thought no one would notice.

01:17:16.457 --> 01:17:19.551
-We've made a mistake!
-A mistake?

01:17:20.294 --> 01:17:24.025
You failed.
You can never return.

01:17:24.131 --> 01:17:27.794
-lt was an accident!
-You cannot return.

01:17:27.902 --> 01:17:31.861
The moon will be full in three days.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:38.140
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

01:17:38.246 --> 01:17:42.114
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them

01:17:42.183 --> 01:17:46.279
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

01:17:46.854 --> 01:17:50.847
And we'll vanish along with it.

01:17:51.492 --> 01:17:55.292
You will never see us again.

01:18:06.007 --> 01:18:09.738
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,

01:18:10.478 --> 01:18:12.207
but l think we need your help.

01:18:35.536 --> 01:18:37.094
My God, what have you done to him?

01:18:37.271 --> 01:18:38.397
Not much.

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.138
But things are getting better.

01:18:50.051 --> 01:18:54.784
l like having you handy, Doctor.
lt has its advantages.

01:18:56.324 --> 01:18:57.791
Serrano, stay here.

01:18:57.959 --> 01:18:59.017
l talked.

01:19:00.428 --> 01:19:01.656
Not much.

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:07.467
-B-b-but l talked.
-l'm sorry.

01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:09.794
l'm so sorry.

01:19:16.944 --> 01:19:22.075
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

01:19:38.265 --> 01:19:39.857
Son of a bitch.

01:20:00.955 --> 01:20:02.889
lt'll take away the pain.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:10.730
lt's almost over.

01:20:19.473 --> 01:20:20.804
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:22.408
-l'll be right there.
-Yes, Captain.

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:47.558
You're not moving anymore.

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:50.503
Are you sick?

01:20:53.707 --> 01:20:56.232
What are you doing down there?

01:21:09.824 --> 01:21:11.485
-Call him!
-Who?

01:21:11.592 --> 01:21:13.992
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

01:21:38.085 --> 01:21:40.178
What the hell is this?

01:21:43.257 --> 01:21:44.849
No! No, no!

01:21:45.092 --> 01:21:48.687
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

01:21:50.397 --> 01:21:52.957
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:54.561
What do you think of this?

01:21:59.173 --> 01:22:03.667
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

01:22:03.878 --> 01:22:07.814
lt's a magic root
the faun gave me.

01:22:07.982 --> 01:22:10.576
This is all because of thatjunk
you let her read.

01:22:10.918 --> 01:22:11.885
Look what you've done!

01:22:12.019 --> 01:22:16.080
Please, leave us alone.
l'll talk to her, darling.

01:22:16.724 --> 01:22:19.659
Fine.
As you wish.

01:22:21.462 --> 01:22:24.158
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

01:22:24.431 --> 01:22:27.332
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:29.761
You have to stop all this.

01:22:30.437 --> 01:22:33.065
No. l want to leave this place!

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:36.570
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:39.008
Things are not that simple.

01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:43.079
You're getting older,

01:22:44.118 --> 01:22:47.485
soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

01:22:48.088 --> 01:22:50.283
The world is a cruel place.

01:22:51.659 --> 01:22:55.390
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

01:22:56.997 --> 01:22:59.522
-No! No!
-Ofelia!

01:23:00.868 --> 01:23:05.828
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

01:23:17.651 --> 01:23:19.915
Mom! Help!

01:23:20.387 --> 01:23:21.820
Help!

01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:23.952
Help!

01:23:29.997 --> 01:23:30.964
Why did you do it?

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.961
lt was the only thing l could do.

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:38.533
No. You could have obeyed me.

01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:42.571
l could have, but l didn't.

01:23:44.511 --> 01:23:47.036
lt would have been better for you.
You know it.

01:23:48.449 --> 01:23:51.418
l don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

01:23:51.719 --> 01:23:57.851
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

01:23:59.593 --> 01:24:02.585
that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

01:24:40.034 --> 01:24:41.365
Captain!

01:24:47.675 --> 01:24:50.041
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

01:24:50.244 --> 01:24:52.735
-Get up immediately!
-Yes, Captain.

01:25:27.381 --> 01:25:29.246
Your wife is dead.

01:25:38.926 --> 01:25:42.418
Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.

01:25:42.896 --> 01:25:44.761
Because the essence
of His forgiveness

01:25:44.832 --> 01:25:48.165
lies in His word
and in His mystery.

01:25:49.036 --> 01:25:52.028
Because although God
sends us the message,

01:25:52.172 --> 01:25:54.800
it is our task to decipher it.

01:25:55.676 --> 01:25:57.507
Because when we open our arms

01:25:57.678 --> 01:26:02.547
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.

01:26:03.917 --> 01:26:06.852
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:11.117
Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.

01:26:11.925 --> 01:26:14.860
And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.

01:26:16.196 --> 01:26:21.463
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.

01:26:25.539 --> 01:26:28.030
And because it is only
in His physical absence,

01:26:28.208 --> 01:26:32.474
that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.

01:26:54.435 --> 01:26:57.927
You knew
Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,
didn't you, Mercedes?

01:26:59.006 --> 01:27:01.941
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

01:27:03.911 --> 01:27:07.540
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

01:27:08.715 --> 01:27:12.583
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

01:27:14.421 --> 01:27:17.857
Mercedes, please.

01:27:27.601 --> 01:27:29.034
What must you think of me?

01:27:30.304 --> 01:27:31.896
You must think that
l'm a monster.

01:27:32.439 --> 01:27:35.340
lt doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

01:27:45.519 --> 01:27:48.420
l want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

01:27:48.689 --> 01:27:51.886
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

01:27:52.459 --> 01:27:56.418
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

01:27:57.464 --> 01:27:58.453
Sir?

01:28:03.504 --> 01:28:04.402
The key.

01:28:05.439 --> 01:28:07.771
l do have the only copy, don't l?

01:28:08.976 --> 01:28:09.965
Yes, sir.

01:28:11.512 --> 01:28:15.505
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

01:28:15.849 --> 01:28:17.783
Maybe it's not important, but...

01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:19.643
the day they broke into
the storehouse,

01:28:19.887 --> 01:28:22.219
with all those grenades
and explosives,

01:28:23.123 --> 01:28:24.613
the lock itself wasn't forced.

01:28:26.927 --> 01:28:30.522
As l said, it's probably
not important.

01:28:34.134 --> 01:28:35.431
Be very careful.

01:28:37.538 --> 01:28:38.766
Good night, sir.

01:29:21.615 --> 01:29:24.379
Ofelia, Ofelia!

01:29:24.651 --> 01:29:26.676
Ofelia, l'm leaving tonight.

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:30.712
-Where to?
-l can't tell you. l can't tell you...

01:29:30.824 --> 01:29:33.850
-Take me with you.
-No, no. l can't.

01:29:33.961 --> 01:29:36.987
l can't, my child. But l'll come
back for you, l promise.

01:29:37.130 --> 01:29:38.256
Take me with you.

01:30:03.156 --> 01:30:04.453
l heard something.

01:30:09.429 --> 01:30:12.592
lt's nothing, don't worry.

01:30:21.942 --> 01:30:22.931
Mercedes.

01:30:25.112 --> 01:30:26.079
Ofelia.

01:30:35.088 --> 01:30:36.715
How long have
you known about her?

01:30:42.129 --> 01:30:43.687
How long have you been
laughing at me?

01:30:43.930 --> 01:30:45.124
Little bitch!

01:30:46.466 --> 01:30:47.728
Watch her!

01:30:51.204 --> 01:30:52.933
And if anyone tries to get in,

01:30:53.907 --> 01:30:55.499
kill her first.

01:31:09.823 --> 01:31:10.790
Dry meat.

01:31:14.394 --> 01:31:15.383
Tobacco.

01:31:16.697 --> 01:31:19.461
lf you had asked for it, l would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

01:31:26.673 --> 01:31:28.903
l want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

01:31:30.644 --> 01:31:32.805
And l want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:34.204
Yes, Captain.

01:31:37.084 --> 01:31:38.551
You can go, Garces.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.519
You're sure, Captain?

01:31:43.957 --> 01:31:46.721
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

01:31:50.697 --> 01:31:52.858
That's what you've always thought.

01:31:54.034 --> 01:31:56.832
That's why l was able to get away with it.

01:31:57.070 --> 01:32:01.734
-l was invisible to you.
-Damn.

01:32:02.576 --> 01:32:06.376
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

01:32:07.781 --> 01:32:11.114
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

01:32:13.487 --> 01:32:16.422
lt's very simple: you will talk...

01:32:18.125 --> 01:32:19.149
And l have to know

01:32:21.128 --> 01:32:22.425
that everything you say is the truth.

01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:27.929
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:31.132
Nothing complicated.

01:32:33.974 --> 01:32:35.498
Things we learn on the job.

01:32:37.611 --> 01:32:39.579
At first...

01:32:56.696 --> 01:32:59.927
l'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.061
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

01:33:04.304 --> 01:33:06.067
Won't be the first pig l gutted.

01:33:29.563 --> 01:33:30.655
Look! He let her go.

01:33:33.166 --> 01:33:34.463
The fuck did you say?

01:33:42.475 --> 01:33:45.171
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

01:33:45.612 --> 01:33:47.443
Bring her to me, damn it!

01:33:47.581 --> 01:33:49.071
Mount up!

01:34:52.012 --> 01:34:54.503
lt'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

01:34:55.148 --> 01:34:57.173
The Captain said that if you behave...

01:35:01.821 --> 01:35:03.584
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

01:35:03.957 --> 01:35:05.515
lf anyone's going to kill you...

01:35:07.627 --> 01:35:08.821
l'd rather it be me.

01:36:19.199 --> 01:36:24.136
l've decided to give you
one last chance.

01:36:29.409 --> 01:36:31.104
Do you promise to do what l say?

01:36:33.113 --> 01:36:37.345
Will you do everything l tell you,
without question?

01:36:39.152 --> 01:36:42.121
This is your last chance.

01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:46.384
Then listen to me.

01:36:46.826 --> 01:36:49.226
Fetch your brother

01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:52.291
and bring him to the labyrinth,

01:36:52.432 --> 01:36:56.835
as quickly as you can,
Your Highness.

01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:58.401
My brother?

01:36:58.638 --> 01:36:59.969
We need him.

01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:03.166
-But...
-No more questions.

01:37:06.179 --> 01:37:07.737
The door's locked.

01:37:08.748 --> 01:37:14.653
ln that case,
create your own door.

01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:04.722
Captain, with your permission.

01:40:08.094 --> 01:40:09.118
Come quickly.

01:40:09.896 --> 01:40:13.161
-Now what?
-Serrano is back. He's wounded.

01:40:14.133 --> 01:40:15.498
Wounded?

01:41:01.714 --> 01:41:03.113
Where's Garces?

01:41:10.590 --> 01:41:11.579
How many were there?

01:41:12.125 --> 01:41:14.355
l don't know exactly, Captain.

01:41:14.794 --> 01:41:16.284
Fifty men, at least.

01:41:16.396 --> 01:41:19.991
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

01:41:20.133 --> 01:41:23.728
-How many men we have left?
-Twenty, maybe less, sir.

01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:37.914
We're leaving.
Together.

01:41:38.951 --> 01:41:40.213
Don't be afraid.

01:41:41.087 --> 01:41:42.748
Nothing is going to happen to you.

01:41:49.128 --> 01:41:50.755
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

01:41:50.897 --> 01:41:53.024
lf the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

01:41:53.266 --> 01:41:56.758
Radio for reinforcements, now.

01:41:56.936 --> 01:41:58.233
Yes, Captain.

01:42:25.064 --> 01:42:26.292
Leave him!

01:43:12.378 --> 01:43:13.640
Ofelia!

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.496
Quickly, Your Majesty,

01:44:43.769 --> 01:44:46.294
give him to me.

01:44:46.839 --> 01:44:49.933
The full moon is high in the sky,

01:44:50.042 --> 01:44:52.875
we can open the portal.

01:44:53.779 --> 01:44:55.406
Why is that in your hand?

01:44:56.916 --> 01:45:01.819
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

01:45:02.121 --> 01:45:06.558
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

01:45:06.659 --> 01:45:09.253
lt's the final task.

01:45:09.562 --> 01:45:10.893
Hurry.

01:45:13.599 --> 01:45:16.693
You promised to obey me!

01:45:17.136 --> 01:45:19.366
-Give me the boy!
-No!

01:45:19.972 --> 01:45:22.099
My brother stays with me.

01:45:22.341 --> 01:45:28.246
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

01:45:28.314 --> 01:45:31.112
Yes, l would.

01:45:32.418 --> 01:45:34.886
You would give up
your throne for him?

01:45:35.021 --> 01:45:39.617
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

01:45:40.159 --> 01:45:43.026
Yes, l would.

01:45:47.133 --> 01:45:52.833
As you wish, Your Highness.

01:46:08.554 --> 01:46:09.578
No!

01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.269
My son.

01:47:36.876 --> 01:47:38.537
Tell my son...

01:47:44.383 --> 01:47:46.476
Tell him what time his father died.

01:47:47.286 --> 01:47:48.583
-Tell him that l...
-No.

01:47:49.789 --> 01:47:51.552
He won't even know your name.

01:49:34.393 --> 01:49:36.418
Arise, my daughter.

01:49:39.732 --> 01:49:40.994
Come.

01:50:07.226 --> 01:50:08.454
Father.

01:50:08.961 --> 01:50:12.590
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

01:50:13.365 --> 01:50:17.199
That was the final task,
and the most important.

01:50:27.713 --> 01:50:32.980
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

01:50:33.219 --> 01:50:34.880
Come here with me,

01:50:35.754 --> 01:50:37.881
and sit by your father's side.

01:50:38.357 --> 01:50:40.552
He's been waiting for you so long.

01:51:33.479 --> 01:51:37.245
And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

01:51:38.183 --> 01:51:43.519
That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.

01:51:44.423 --> 01:51:46.687
That she was loved by her people.

01:51:46.959 --> 01:51:51.658
And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth,

01:51:52.765 --> 01:51:57.600
visible only to those
who know where to look.
