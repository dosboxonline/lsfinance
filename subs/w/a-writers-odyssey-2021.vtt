00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:31.574


3
00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:42.159
Daddy!

4
00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:52.537
Daddy!

5
00:00:59.943 --> 00:01:01.245
Daddy!

6
00:01:02.112 --> 00:01:03.080
Tangerine!

7
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.249
Daddy!

8
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:07.319
Tangerine!

9
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:52.263
Everything's still the same.

10
00:01:52.297 --> 00:01:55.467
Every night, I dream about
my dear Tangerine.

11
00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:02.340
And that strange city that
always feels like it's calling,

12
00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:05.976
it keeps calling me.

13
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.352
What does it mean?

14
00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:45.650
What in the world was that?

15
00:02:46.384 --> 00:02:47.217
Look out!

16
00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:50.020
What the... whoa!

17
00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:02.567
Hold on!

18
00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:26.257
You're mine!

19
00:03:37.435 --> 00:03:38.336
Stop!

20
00:03:39.203 --> 00:03:41.171
Stop! Enough.

21
00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.173
You're killing him.

22
00:03:43.207 --> 00:03:45.008
Stop it, stop.

23
00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:52.317
Look at her.

24
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.551
Look, I told you to look at her!

25
00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:59.324
Six years ago, in Liaoyuan,
you took my little girl from me.

26
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.659
Where is she now? Tell me!

27
00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:03.695
Where is she now?

28
00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:05.095
Speak!

29
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.603
Come on, get up, hurry!

30
00:04:12.604 --> 00:04:14.238
Come on!

31
00:04:14.272 --> 00:04:15.440
- Let's go.
- I'm all right.

32
00:04:15.473 --> 00:04:17.241
Let's move!

33
00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:21.078
We're not done.

34
00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:43.801
Tangerine!

35
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.105
Tangerine?

36
00:04:48.138 --> 00:04:49.407
No, that's not her.

37
00:04:49.874 --> 00:04:51.543
Tangerine? Tangerine?

38
00:04:52.644 --> 00:04:54.044
Tangerine, Tangerine.

39
00:04:55.313 --> 00:04:57.180
Tangerine? Not her.

40
00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.215
Tangerine?

41
00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:01.853
She's not here.

42
00:05:01.886 --> 00:05:03.655
She's not...

43
00:05:26.678 --> 00:05:27.512
Check the back of the
truck, let's go!

44
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.818
Arrest him!
Get these kids outta here!

45
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:35.152
Yes sir!

46
00:05:51.168 --> 00:05:53.538
Unit two to
dispatch, we are inbound to HQ,

47
00:05:53.571 --> 00:05:55.573
be on high alert,
we have a suspect in custody,

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:53.731
Daddy!

61
00:06:53.998 --> 00:06:55.133
Tangerine!

62
00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.467
Officer Wu, please come in.

63
00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:58.703
- What's your status?
- We're all good here.

64
00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:01.305
We're still on our way back to
HQ with the suspect.

65
00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.508
We got real lucky,
this guy's bad.

66
00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:05.276
Really?
What makes you say that?

67
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.879
He had six
children stuffed in a van.

68
00:07:07.912 --> 00:07:10.247
These child traffickers
are the scum of the earth.

69
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:11.883
You're right about
that, sick bastards!

70
00:07:11.916 --> 00:07:13.785
We're on the move.
See you soon, out.

71
00:07:21.993 --> 00:07:23.561
Please give that back to me!

72
00:07:23.594 --> 00:07:25.263
Hey, cut it out, behave!

73
00:07:25.763 --> 00:07:26.898
Just give me back my picture!

74
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:27.732
Let go!

75
00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:30.601
- Give it back!
- What are you doing?

76
00:07:31.302 --> 00:07:32.637
Give it back!

77
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:33.871
- Just give it back!
- You're insane!

78
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.742
Sit back!

79
00:07:38.476 --> 00:07:39.577
Let go!

80
00:07:40.778 --> 00:07:41.913
Let go, stop it!

81
00:07:41.946 --> 00:07:43.314
Hey, what's going on!

82
00:07:46.284 --> 00:07:47.618
Open up!

83
00:07:47.652 --> 00:07:49.654
Open this door right now!

84
00:07:49.687 --> 00:07:50.488
Nowhere to go.

85
00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:52.356
Officer Wu!
Officer Wu!

86
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:54.692
Give up!

87
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.661
Open this door!

88
00:07:58.863 --> 00:08:00.264
Officer Wu! Come on!

89
00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:03.835
Wu, he's getting away!

90
00:08:03.868 --> 00:08:05.036
The keys are gone.

91
00:08:08.573 --> 00:08:09.674
Freeze!

92
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:12.610
I said freeze!

93
00:08:28.659 --> 00:08:30.628
Staring won't help.

94
00:08:30.661 --> 00:08:31.896
I'm sure you don't know me.

95
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.633
But you, you're quickly becoming
our most valued asset.

96
00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:39.337
What are you talking about?

97
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.739
Your name's Guan Ning,
you're from Liaoyuan.

98
00:08:41.773 --> 00:08:43.841
You had a successful
banking career

99
00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:45.643
until about six years ago,

100
00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:46.711
when your daughter went missing.

101
00:08:46.744 --> 00:08:48.679
Since then you've been
desperately looking for her

102
00:08:48.713 --> 00:08:51.349
and failing miserably
for six years.

103
00:08:51.382 --> 00:08:52.316
That's sad.

104
00:08:53.384 --> 00:08:54.385
I think you look tired.

105
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.321
How are you sleeping these days?

106
00:08:57.588 --> 00:08:58.856
None of your business.

107
00:09:00.591 --> 00:09:03.027
I think you're just
afraid to fall asleep,

108
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.597
because of the nightmares,
about your daughter,

109
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:08.866
and that strange city, am I right?

110
00:09:14.806 --> 00:09:16.541
That's right, you're the one.

111
00:09:17.475 --> 00:09:18.476
Pull over.

112
00:09:19.677 --> 00:09:20.878
Pull over, right now!

113
00:09:30.822 --> 00:09:31.823
Did you forget?

114
00:09:32.924 --> 00:09:35.026
The police are still
looking for you.

115
00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:38.663
I didn't do anything wrong,
I'm turning myself in.

116
00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:41.632
Go back and you may be
able to clear your name,

117
00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:42.934
but you'll never
find your daughter.

118
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.505
You have to make a choice.

119
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.878
What did you say?

120
00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:15.993
Leave him alone!

121
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:35.613
Go west.

122
00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:37.548
- Save yourself.
- I won't leave you.

123
00:11:41.218 --> 00:11:43.888
It's all right, time to go.

124
00:12:43.881 --> 00:12:45.283
My sister!

125
00:13:04.835 --> 00:13:05.970
You're alive.

126
00:13:06.003 --> 00:13:08.806
I told you... to run!

127
00:13:22.753 --> 00:13:23.754
I'm here.

128
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:27.292
Please!

129
00:13:28.692 --> 00:13:31.263
Run... away.

130
00:13:32.897 --> 00:13:35.800
Do it, now.

131
00:13:45.377 --> 00:13:48.879
By sacred order of
the great Lord Redmane,

132
00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.817
your heads are to
be swiftly removed.

133
00:13:55.253 --> 00:13:57.922
The dead cannot be resurrected.

134
00:13:57.955 --> 00:14:00.292
Sorry, kid.

135
00:14:05.763 --> 00:14:09.066
Damn it, this really hurts!

136
00:14:10.668 --> 00:14:11.269
Come.

137
00:14:13.237 --> 00:14:15.206
Cut off this girl's head for me

138
00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:18.343
and take me to the healer
in the village nearby,

139
00:14:18.376 --> 00:14:20.312
and I promise you a good death.

140
00:14:31.155 --> 00:14:33.358
Hey, you can't kill me.

141
00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:39.763
I bear the mark of the
great Lord...

142
00:15:01.852 --> 00:15:06.190
Dear sister,
we've been running for years.

143
00:15:08.893 --> 00:15:10.395
I think it's time
to stop running!

144
00:15:16.268 --> 00:15:18.436
You should listen
to your sister, kid.

145
00:15:23.408 --> 00:15:25.443
Let's see how far you can get.

146
00:15:25.477 --> 00:15:27.878
I doubt it'll be
very far indeed.

147
00:15:37.154 --> 00:15:38.822
Hey!

148
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:43.194
Once Lord Redmane lays
claim to your life,

149
00:15:43.227 --> 00:15:44.962
you are as good as dead.

150
00:15:45.297 --> 00:15:47.432
Your rotting head will be
hanged as an ornament

151
00:15:47.465 --> 00:15:49.934
outside the citadel
for all to see.

152
00:15:50.134 --> 00:15:52.370
And after your sister's
body is desecrated,

153
00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:54.171
her head will hang
next to yours.

154
00:15:54.472 --> 00:15:58.976
Knocking each other in the wind
over and over and over,

155
00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:02.480
like two big, round meatballs
left out to dry.

156
00:16:04.782 --> 00:16:07.117
You don't even stand a chance.

157
00:16:07.151 --> 00:16:10.422
You're going up against powers
beyond your comprehension.

158
00:16:10.455 --> 00:16:12.257
You're going to die.

159
00:16:12.856 --> 00:16:14.892
Dear sister,
I'm done running away.

160
00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:16.394
Now I must seek retribution.

161
00:17:15.853 --> 00:17:18.590
I couldn't stand that old
man's disgusting blood anymore,

162
00:17:18.623 --> 00:17:20.292
just unbearable!

163
00:17:20.325 --> 00:17:22.594
It made me go to
sleep for forty years!

164
00:17:22.627 --> 00:17:24.329
You on the other hand taste...

165
00:17:25.497 --> 00:17:26.498
What do you think you're doing?

166
00:17:27.399 --> 00:17:28.899
You wanna poke my eye out?

167
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.270
That's no way for a
meatball to behave.

168
00:17:32.304 --> 00:17:34.506
That's it! You're my meatball.

169
00:17:37.542 --> 00:17:40.077
There's fire in this meatball,

170
00:17:40.578 --> 00:17:42.447
and he wants to slay a god?

171
00:17:42.946 --> 00:17:45.317
Mm, I know, I know,
I know, I know.

172
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.520
I'll tell you what,
I'll stick around until you die,

173
00:18:07.639 --> 00:18:09.474
Ah!

174
00:18:10.007 --> 00:18:10.908
You see that?

175
00:18:12.444 --> 00:18:14.845
That's where Redmane is.

176
00:18:15.145 --> 00:18:19.116
Go forth and take your revenge,
if you dare.

177
00:18:28.626 --> 00:18:31.629
Around seven years ago,
I drove all the way

178
00:18:31.663 --> 00:18:36.066
across the city to get some
of my favorite meat dumplings.

179
00:18:37.435 --> 00:18:40.505
It was a two-hour drive and
then I had to wait in line.

180
00:18:40.538 --> 00:18:41.905
You only need one traffic jam

181
00:18:41.939 --> 00:18:44.875
and that's two hours of your
life that are gone forever.

182
00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.345
Time is so precious.

183
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.015
Time is the final problem that
humanity must solve.

184
00:18:53.217 --> 00:18:54.619
For all of us here
at the Aladdin Group,

185
00:18:54.652 --> 00:18:56.954
our goal is always to give you

186
00:18:56.987 --> 00:18:58.590
absolute control of your time.

187
00:18:59.524 --> 00:19:02.660
Today we use the Lamp app
to save time, to play games,

188
00:19:02.694 --> 00:19:05.028
to chat, and to shop.

189
00:19:05.363 --> 00:19:08.500
You can even use it to see a
doctor, or to report a crime.

190
00:19:10.134 --> 00:19:12.370
But most importantly,
to find good dumplings.

191
00:19:14.639 --> 00:19:17.409
In the past, it would take two
hours to accomplish one task,

192
00:19:17.442 --> 00:19:21.346
but now, we've made it possible
to be 10 times more productive,

193
00:19:21.379 --> 00:19:24.649
because we all are
the masters of our time.

194
00:19:32.724 --> 00:19:34.392
He's so full of it.

195
00:19:35.159 --> 00:19:36.394
Stop wasting my time!

196
00:19:41.131 --> 00:19:43.200
I'm Aladdin Group's CIO.

197
00:19:43.233 --> 00:19:45.437
That's Chief Information
Officer. Name's Ling.

198
00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:47.237
Get to the point already.

199
00:19:47.505 --> 00:19:49.006
What do you know
about my daughter?

200
00:19:49.707 --> 00:19:51.241
We think we already found her.

201
00:20:03.588 --> 00:20:05.256
Well, maybe
we didn't find her,

202
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.324
if you wanna get technical.

203
00:20:07.425 --> 00:20:10.428
But we did manage to
significantly narrow the search.

204
00:20:10.795 --> 00:20:15.132
Yes, we're sure one of these
five girls is your daughter.

205
00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:19.404
Do you recognize her?

206
00:20:26.176 --> 00:20:28.546
She's... I don't...

207
00:20:31.416 --> 00:20:32.717
I can't recognize her.

208
00:20:33.485 --> 00:20:35.587
I can't even recognize
my own child.

209
00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:37.622
Don't blame yourself.

210
00:20:37.655 --> 00:20:40.123
She'll look very different
after so many years.

211
00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:54.137
But not to worry, once we run
a DNA test on all of 'em,

212
00:20:54.171 --> 00:20:55.239
we'll know with certainty.

213
00:20:57.475 --> 00:20:59.209
How long will it
take to run the test?

214
00:21:12.089 --> 00:21:13.324
What do you want from me?

215
00:21:18.095 --> 00:21:19.129
We're right on time.

216
00:21:22.232 --> 00:21:23.535
Welcome back.

217
00:21:24.802 --> 00:21:26.404
Today I'll continue reading
my new story for you.

218
00:21:26.738 --> 00:21:28.105
When we left off,

219
00:21:29.307 --> 00:21:31.442
- our hero's sister...
- Is this live?

220
00:21:31.476 --> 00:21:32.744
...supporting
her exhausted body.

221
00:21:32.777 --> 00:21:35.280
Mm, it's a live stream.

222
00:21:35.313 --> 00:21:36.381
She looks
up at Kongwen,

223
00:21:37.649 --> 00:21:40.585
and then with a sweet smile
she says, "Go west.

224
00:21:40.618 --> 00:21:42.287
Save yourself."

225
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.721
But before she can finish,

226
00:21:43.755 --> 00:21:45.290
she's violently thrown
to the ground

227
00:21:45.323 --> 00:21:46.824
while the enemy
stands above her.

228
00:21:48.426 --> 00:21:52.764
It's the evil old monk,
armed with his mighty black saber,

229
00:21:52.797 --> 00:21:55.700
he pierces the sister's back
without showing any mercy,

230
00:21:56.801 --> 00:21:58.369
and our hero must
watch helplessly,

231
00:21:58.403 --> 00:22:00.137
as her life slowly fades away.

232
00:22:03.675 --> 00:22:06.143
In front of Kongwen,
towards the northeast,

233
00:22:06.176 --> 00:22:09.514
several hundred miles away,
a light gleams in the distance.

234
00:22:10.682 --> 00:22:13.216
Kongwen looks
closely at the light,

235
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.652
and in the distance sees...

236
00:22:14.686 --> 00:22:15.486
A city.

237
00:22:16.888 --> 00:22:17.822
...a city.

238
00:22:20.792 --> 00:22:22.827
Sunlight shines
through the clouds,

239
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.263
and envelopes the
city completely,

240
00:22:25.296 --> 00:22:27.432
and below, a massive
ancient citadel.

241
00:22:27.865 --> 00:22:29.667
It's truly glorious.

242
00:22:29.701 --> 00:22:31.703
The mighty capital
of the Ranliang Kingdom.

243
00:22:31.736 --> 00:22:33.136
Isn't that
place also know as...

244
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:34.305
The City of Clouds.

245
00:22:34.606 --> 00:22:35.406
Your dream.

246
00:22:36.474 --> 00:22:37.742
Huh?

247
00:22:37.775 --> 00:22:39.877
At that moment,
up on the hill,

248
00:22:40.612 --> 00:22:42.580
deep within
the reaches of the palace,

249
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.216
Redmane felt fear for the
first time in a long time.

250
00:22:49.787 --> 00:22:53.223
The Lamp app will dramatically
improve your quality of life,

251
00:22:53.257 --> 00:22:57.261
because time and distance
will no longer exist.

252
00:22:57.295 --> 00:22:59.831
The young man's eyes
remained fixated.

253
00:22:59.864 --> 00:23:02.467
Aladdin is always by your side.

254
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.236
And I am by your side.

255
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.373
His resolve grew
as he gripped the blade...

256
00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:16.381
...tightly in his hands.

257
00:23:16.414 --> 00:23:18.483
And at that moment
the mighty Redmane

258
00:23:18.516 --> 00:23:20.485
suddenly had a
splitting headache

259
00:23:22.453 --> 00:23:24.922
caused by
a very old head wound,

260
00:23:24.956 --> 00:23:26.758
which had suddenly burst open.

261
00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:31.796
The pain was
so incredibly intense

262
00:23:31.829 --> 00:23:34.499
that it brought the mighty
giant down to its knees.

263
00:23:40.705 --> 00:23:42.774
Just now,
Aladdin Group President, Mu Li,

264
00:23:42.807 --> 00:23:44.842
suddenly fainted during
his keynote speech.

265
00:23:44.876 --> 00:23:46.911
What began as a small
life-sciences company

266
00:23:46.944 --> 00:23:48.746
has grown into
dozens of sectors

267
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.715
as a large multinational
conglomerate.

268
00:23:51.883 --> 00:23:54.252
For many years, Mr. Li has led
Aladdin's development...

269
00:24:02.627 --> 00:24:03.394
Excuse me sir?

270
00:24:05.763 --> 00:24:07.365
What did
he write this time?

271
00:24:07.865 --> 00:24:09.367
He's writing about Kongwen.

272
00:24:10.802 --> 00:24:13.604
He went to the capital
and Redmane sensed it,

273
00:24:14.572 --> 00:24:16.239
causing his head
wound to open up.

274
00:24:27.752 --> 00:24:29.654
Are you sure he's
the one we need?

275
00:24:29.687 --> 00:24:31.789
He's the only one that
might agree to do what I need.

276
00:24:32.824 --> 00:24:34.625
He managed to
lose his own child,

277
00:24:35.326 --> 00:24:36.494
he's not reliable.

278
00:24:38.362 --> 00:24:41.599
Listen, Ling, I know that
you were abandoned...

279
00:24:42.366 --> 00:24:45.603
by your parents,
but stop projecting.

280
00:24:46.337 --> 00:24:48.906
Don't confuse
your personal life with work.

281
00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.741
Understood.

282
00:24:56.414 --> 00:24:57.482
So what will it take?

283
00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:02.553
How far are you willing to go to
get your daughter back?

284
00:25:02.587 --> 00:25:03.788
- I'll do anything.
- That's good.

285
00:25:04.989 --> 00:25:05.790
That's good.

286
00:25:07.358 --> 00:25:08.493
You'll have to kill.

287
00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:11.462
Kill?

288
00:25:11.896 --> 00:25:13.464
Don't push too fast.

289
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:15.466
You'll be using
your special powers.

290
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.902
We know all about those.

291
00:25:20.638 --> 00:25:21.639
You're not the first one
we've found with such powers,

292
00:25:21.672 --> 00:25:23.574
some feel no pain.

293
00:25:23.608 --> 00:25:26.744
Others produce energy
and then there's you.

294
00:25:27.879 --> 00:25:29.847
You can throw
different projectiles

295
00:25:29.881 --> 00:25:32.350
with lethal power and
incredible accuracy.

296
00:25:32.683 --> 00:25:33.684
Look at this.

297
00:25:34.819 --> 00:25:36.487
You can even re-direct it.

298
00:25:37.922 --> 00:25:38.623
Killing someone
wouldn't be difficult for you.

299
00:25:40.825 --> 00:25:42.360
How long have you
been watching me?

300
00:25:47.465 --> 00:25:50.501
Every day we collect and
analyze multiple sources of data,

301
00:25:51.369 --> 00:25:53.738
keeping an eye out
for anything that's useful.

302
00:25:54.939 --> 00:25:57.575
That's actually how we were
able to connect

303
00:25:57.608 --> 00:25:58.776
those girls to you.

304
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.525
Who do you need me to kill?

305
00:26:15.626 --> 00:26:16.794
The target is a writer.

306
00:26:18.229 --> 00:26:18.729
The man you
just saw on that live stream,

307
00:26:19.564 --> 00:26:20.531
his book is titled Godslayer,

308
00:26:20.565 --> 00:26:21.933
and the writer's
name is Kongwen.

309
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.635
Here's the thing.

310
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:26.971
My boss is convinced that
what happens in the story

311
00:26:27.004 --> 00:26:28.406
is somehow affecting his health.

312
00:26:28.673 --> 00:26:29.874
He what?

313
00:26:31.042 --> 00:26:31.909
There's a character
in the story called Redmane.

314
00:26:32.844 --> 00:26:34.078
Every time something
happens to Redmane,

315
00:26:34.545 --> 00:26:35.947
my boss faints
like you just saw.

316
00:26:36.914 --> 00:26:38.516
This is the third time that
something like this happens

317
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:39.884
as far as we know.

318
00:26:39.917 --> 00:26:42.053
We've already exhausted
every legal avenue

319
00:26:42.086 --> 00:26:44.722
to stop him from writing,
but nothing's worked.

320
00:26:44.755 --> 00:26:46.824
And now, the writer
has announced

321
00:26:47.525 --> 00:26:49.760
that he'll finish the story
in the next three days.

322
00:26:49.794 --> 00:26:51.596
And given how it's
played out so far,

323
00:26:54.165 --> 00:26:55.633
Redmane is likely to die.

324
00:26:59.604 --> 00:27:00.972
You people
are out of your minds.

325
00:27:04.442 --> 00:27:07.511
Your boss is afraid of actually
being written to death?

326
00:27:09.747 --> 00:27:11.048
I know how strange it sounds.

327
00:27:11.749 --> 00:27:14.018
- Do you now?
- My boss believes it's all real.

328
00:27:17.788 --> 00:27:20.925
In any case, if you're not
interested in working with us,

329
00:27:20.958 --> 00:27:21.926
then you're free to go.

330
00:27:34.605 --> 00:27:35.907
Where will
I find this writer?

331
00:27:36.507 --> 00:27:38.075
In the Twin River City.

332
00:27:38.109 --> 00:27:40.411
I will kill him
for my daughter.

333
00:27:41.612 --> 00:27:43.214
You only have three days.

334
00:27:43.247 --> 00:27:46.117
If you want to find your daughter,
this is your last chance.

335
00:27:47.818 --> 00:27:49.620
We'll need you to keep
a detailed journal,

336
00:27:49.654 --> 00:27:50.955
and keep us updated.

337
00:27:50.988 --> 00:27:52.123
You don't wanna let us down.

338
00:27:58.162 --> 00:27:59.597
Young Kongwen
descended Sacred Wood Peak,

339
00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.768
he left Mount Di,
and went north to the City of Clouds.

340
00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:07.204
The first 200 miles
were extremely hard.

341
00:28:08.572 --> 00:28:10.074
Kongwen was traveling on foot.

342
00:28:10.741 --> 00:28:13.077
Upon reaching the
Luoshui River port,

343
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.979
he boarded a freighter bound
for the capital.

344
00:28:23.255 --> 00:28:25.189
The strange waves
and water beasts

345
00:28:25.957 --> 00:28:28.559
frightened the young Kongwen.

346
00:28:28.592 --> 00:28:30.194
But luckily,
he avoided getting seasick.

347
00:28:31.228 --> 00:28:33.731
What was to come,
Kongwen didn't know.

348
00:28:34.598 --> 00:28:37.568
All he knew was that
if he didn't look for Redmane,

349
00:28:39.603 --> 00:28:42.106
there was no point for him
to continue living.

350
00:28:43.308 --> 00:28:46.610
Because Redmane was
the only soul in the world

351
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:49.213
who was expecting
to see Kongwen.

352
00:28:50.681 --> 00:28:52.583
Land ahoy,
prepare to drop anchor!

353
00:28:52.616 --> 00:28:55.086
Redmane could
sense Kongwen's presence.

354
00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.089
He remembered
Kongwen's father.

355
00:29:00.024 --> 00:29:01.158
Once a friend to Redmane

356
00:29:02.727 --> 00:29:05.563
and the only man that
he had ever feared.

357
00:29:06.864 --> 00:29:10.868
"Very well," said Redmane
with a faint smirk,

358
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:14.238
for the truth was he'd been
lonely for far too long.

359
00:29:17.641 --> 00:29:18.809
Oh, that was bad!

360
00:29:30.221 --> 00:29:31.889
Hey, Kongwen, how are you doing?

361
00:29:33.124 --> 00:29:34.525
What a rude boy!

362
00:29:47.238 --> 00:29:49.206
Vegetables
are so cheap today!

363
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.875
Yes, really cheap!

364
00:30:07.758 --> 00:30:10.061
- Pass it over here!
- Hey I'm open, pass!

365
00:30:10.094 --> 00:30:12.129
- Pass it! Come on!
- How did he score?

366
00:30:12.163 --> 00:30:13.798
- What were you thinking?
- Come on!

367
00:30:13.831 --> 00:30:15.833
- Are you a moron?
- Oh, man!

368
00:30:15.866 --> 00:30:17.968
- What's wrong with you?
- Kick higher, higher!

369
00:30:18.002 --> 00:30:19.870
- Over here!
- Go! Over here,

370
00:30:19.904 --> 00:30:21.872
- over here, come on!
- Hey, you're a grownup!

371
00:30:21.906 --> 00:30:24.175
- Pick on someone your own size!
- I'm open, I'm over here!

372
00:30:24.208 --> 00:30:26.210
Pass it to me!
Come on, come on!

373
00:30:26.243 --> 00:30:27.878
- Pass it!
- Aim for his head!

374
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.748
- What?
- This guy's a loser.

375
00:30:35.853 --> 00:30:38.356
Kongwen, time for lunch.

376
00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:40.191
He comes in
every day to get free food.

377
00:30:40.224 --> 00:30:41.359
I can't stand the sight of him.

378
00:30:45.162 --> 00:30:46.730
He's a real parasite.

379
00:31:36.947 --> 00:31:38.316
Uh...

380
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.808
What are you looking at?

381
00:32:05.477 --> 00:32:07.111
I wanna know why
you're following me.

382
00:32:07.144 --> 00:32:07.945
Why I'm what?

383
00:32:17.455 --> 00:32:19.156
I saw you earlier when
I was eating lunch.

384
00:32:20.124 --> 00:32:22.193
And then again when
I was playing soccer.

385
00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.161
Tell me, why are
you following me?

386
00:32:27.031 --> 00:32:28.400
I'm a fan of yours.

387
00:32:29.867 --> 00:32:30.734
You're a fan?

388
00:32:42.246 --> 00:32:43.348
Are you really my fan?

389
00:32:46.351 --> 00:32:47.952
So that's why you followed me!

390
00:32:48.353 --> 00:32:49.787
Yeah.

391
00:32:50.355 --> 00:32:51.356
Where are you from?

392
00:32:51.989 --> 00:32:54.426
Oh, I'm from... from Liaoyuan.

393
00:32:54.459 --> 00:32:55.893
And you came all
that way for me?

394
00:32:56.461 --> 00:32:58.896
Oh my gosh.

395
00:32:58.929 --> 00:33:00.831
- What?
- How did you get here?

396
00:33:00.864 --> 00:33:02.099
- By plane?
- Oh.

397
00:33:02.132 --> 00:33:03.335
- Train?
- By boat.

398
00:33:03.368 --> 00:33:05.069
- And are you married?
- What?

399
00:33:06.504 --> 00:33:07.805
- Well, I'm actually divorced.
- I bet it took ages to get here by boat.

400
00:33:08.205 --> 00:33:10.174
Uh, yeah, right.

401
00:33:10.207 --> 00:33:11.842
Which one of my books
is your favorite?

402
00:33:13.411 --> 00:33:14.778
Uh...

403
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.780
I'd say Godslayer.

404
00:33:18.882 --> 00:33:20.017
Godslayer, huh?

405
00:33:23.321 --> 00:33:25.490
And from that particular story,
what character do you like?

406
00:33:26.458 --> 00:33:29.093
Well of course it is
the brave young Kongwen.

407
00:33:29.294 --> 00:33:31.829
So you really liked the Kongwen
storyline the most?

408
00:33:31.862 --> 00:33:32.830
Yeah.

409
00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:39.571
I guess... the one
with Baihan Fang

410
00:33:39.604 --> 00:33:41.138
is not nearly as interesting.

411
00:33:43.107 --> 00:33:43.907
With who?

412
00:33:45.009 --> 00:33:47.011
With who? Who's "Beihanfeng?"

413
00:33:49.013 --> 00:33:50.914
I've been developing
this new character.

414
00:33:52.484 --> 00:33:54.218
Someone who's been blinded,

415
00:33:54.586 --> 00:33:56.421
and can't see the truth.

416
00:33:57.087 --> 00:33:59.357
But I haven't worked out
how to write it yet.

417
00:34:01.459 --> 00:34:05.095
So Redmane sensed the presence
of the young Kongwen nearby...

418
00:34:09.033 --> 00:34:11.403
- But I should make it clear that...
- Hello.

419
00:34:12.504 --> 00:34:14.071
Why are you
speaking to Kongwen?

420
00:34:14.372 --> 00:34:15.340
Just do your job!

421
00:34:15.873 --> 00:34:17.207
You're spying on me?

422
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:18.576
Is that really
so hard to believe?

423
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.378
You people really have no shame!

424
00:34:33.924 --> 00:34:35.125
Yeah?

425
00:34:36.827 --> 00:34:36.860
Stop talking to
him and finish the job already!

426
00:34:37.696 --> 00:34:38.530
How about you stop
giving me orders!

427
00:34:38.563 --> 00:34:41.198
And tell me, what
does Kongwen mean

428
00:34:41.231 --> 00:34:43.867
by this new character
"Beihanfeng," huh?

429
00:34:43.901 --> 00:34:45.202
I didn't see that in his book.

430
00:34:46.236 --> 00:34:47.905
Didn't you show me
the entire book?

431
00:34:47.938 --> 00:34:49.274
I'm helping you kill someone,

432
00:34:49.507 --> 00:34:51.909
and you're still hiding things
from me, huh?

433
00:34:51.942 --> 00:34:53.311
What difference does
that really make to you?

434
00:34:54.446 --> 00:34:57.114
All right then!
Guess I'll ask Kongwen myself!

435
00:34:57.147 --> 00:34:57.948
What's going on?

436
00:35:04.188 --> 00:35:05.989
It's my fan.

437
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:08.326
Uh, yeah.

438
00:35:09.126 --> 00:35:11.329
Hey, I think I forgot to
ask for your name.

439
00:35:12.397 --> 00:35:13.565
I'm Guan Ning.

440
00:35:13.598 --> 00:35:15.400
Guan Ning. What's up?

441
00:35:19.136 --> 00:35:22.640
You mentioned
a "Beihanfeng" in your story.

442
00:35:22.674 --> 00:35:24.108
It's Baihan Fang.

443
00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:26.110
Who is that?

444
00:35:35.553 --> 00:35:36.987
Are you okay?

445
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.291
You almost killed me!

446
00:35:41.091 --> 00:35:42.494
Sorry guys,
I must've dozed off.

447
00:35:42.527 --> 00:35:43.894
You guys okay?

448
00:35:44.362 --> 00:35:45.363
- I'm fine.
- What do you think!?

449
00:35:46.063 --> 00:35:47.064
I'm sorry.

450
00:35:48.366 --> 00:35:49.534
I just called the police,
they're gonna be here any minute.

451
00:35:49.567 --> 00:35:50.635
Just hang on, all right?

452
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.310
Guan Ning?

453
00:36:00.244 --> 00:36:01.044
Guan Ning?

454
00:36:16.294 --> 00:36:18.530
I didn't dream
about my daughter last night.

455
00:36:18.563 --> 00:36:19.597
That's weird.

456
00:36:20.665 --> 00:36:22.267
But I went into that city.

457
00:36:23.268 --> 00:36:24.269
It was so big.

458
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:26.438
There were armed men.

459
00:36:27.539 --> 00:36:29.441
Something crimson
wrapped on my head.

460
00:36:30.174 --> 00:36:31.975
I couldn't see anything.

461
00:36:32.009 --> 00:36:34.011
I just kept running.

462
00:36:34.044 --> 00:36:35.212
Someone was chasing me.

463
00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:37.715
But I couldn't tell who.

464
00:37:31.235 --> 00:37:32.504
So this
is the capital?

465
00:37:33.438 --> 00:37:34.539
What a city.

466
00:37:36.474 --> 00:37:38.376
Is this some kind of carnival?

467
00:37:41.144 --> 00:37:43.180
You'll find out soon enough.

468
00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:51.456
- Hurry up!
- Kid.

469
00:37:51.489 --> 00:37:52.624
Are you all right, kid?

470
00:37:52.657 --> 00:37:53.791
Grandpa.

471
00:37:54.425 --> 00:37:56.159
I can see you're well-prepared,

472
00:37:56.193 --> 00:37:58.263
that looks like a very strong
armor you have on.

473
00:38:03.233 --> 00:38:05.303
Sir? What's really
going on here?

474
00:38:05.737 --> 00:38:06.704
Where are all
these people going?

475
00:38:07.572 --> 00:38:09.841
To worship Lord Redmane.

476
00:38:38.803 --> 00:38:41.506
All Hail, Lord Redmane!

477
00:38:41.539 --> 00:38:44.107
All Hail, Lord Redmane!

478
00:38:46.311 --> 00:38:48.580
- Kneel down! Come on.
- Purified by fire!

479
00:38:49.547 --> 00:38:52.317
Purified by fire!

480
00:38:52.684 --> 00:38:54.819
When the dragon soars.

481
00:38:55.386 --> 00:38:57.655
When the dragon soars.

482
00:38:58.323 --> 00:39:00.325
All his enemies will fall!

483
00:39:00.358 --> 00:39:03.126
All his
enemies will fall!

484
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:05.797
All Hail, Lord Redmane!

485
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:07.732
- All Hail, Lord Redmane!
- What is this?

486
00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:10.435
- Who is Redmane?
- Purified by fire!

487
00:39:11.402 --> 00:39:13.905
He's no mortal like you.

488
00:39:13.938 --> 00:39:16.274
When the dragon soars.

489
00:39:16.307 --> 00:39:17.675
When the dragon soar!

490
00:39:17.709 --> 00:39:20.210
All his enemies will fall!

491
00:39:20.243 --> 00:39:22.313
All his
enemies will fall!

492
00:39:26.584 --> 00:39:29.554
The dragon
rises, Baihan falls!

493
00:39:29.587 --> 00:39:32.256
The dragon
rises, Baihan falls!

494
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.826
The dragon rises, Baihan falls!

495
00:39:37.562 --> 00:39:38.863
This is no festival.

496
00:39:38.896 --> 00:39:40.932
Oh, of course not,
you're in a battle field.

497
00:39:40.965 --> 00:39:43.801
The City of Clouds used to
have 18 thriving districts,

498
00:39:43.835 --> 00:39:47.170
but now only the dragon district
and Baihan remain standing.

499
00:39:47.204 --> 00:39:48.339
- How come?
- Lord Redmane ordered

500
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.378
all of the districts to start fighting
one another, until there is no one left.

501
00:40:01.251 --> 00:40:01.853
This is a war.

502
00:40:02.553 --> 00:40:04.756
Why does everyone look so happy?

503
00:40:04.789 --> 00:40:06.824
This is the world
of chaos and madness

504
00:40:06.858 --> 00:40:09.460
that has been created
by Lord Redmane.

505
00:40:09.494 --> 00:40:12.830
And you, do you really think
you can kill him?

506
00:40:36.587 --> 00:40:38.256
Archers move forward!

507
00:40:38.289 --> 00:40:39.590
Archers move forward!

508
00:40:41.759 --> 00:40:43.628
Archers move forward!

509
00:41:03.281 --> 00:41:04.415
Fire at will!

510
00:41:04.449 --> 00:41:05.717
Fire at will!

511
00:41:12.957 --> 00:41:15.626
Keep firing! Keep firing!

512
00:41:25.403 --> 00:41:27.672
My boy, take cover!

513
00:41:31.509 --> 00:41:32.810
Fire!

514
00:41:41.052 --> 00:41:42.653
Burn!

515
00:42:14.452 --> 00:42:16.854
- Dragons!
- Dragons!

516
00:42:27.465 --> 00:42:28.866
Take them down!

517
00:42:29.967 --> 00:42:31.335
Fire!

518
00:43:04.635 --> 00:43:06.437
This is tar! It's tar!

519
00:43:16.013 --> 00:43:18.549
Burn, burn, burn, burn!

520
00:43:39.537 --> 00:43:40.972
Burn them all!

521
00:43:41.005 --> 00:43:42.039
Burn them all!

522
00:43:48.713 --> 00:43:51.048
Charge!

523
00:44:23.614 --> 00:44:25.950
No!

524
00:44:25.983 --> 00:44:27.618
- Stop your whining.
- No, let go of me!

525
00:44:27.652 --> 00:44:29.053
- I'm warning you.
- Let go of me.

526
00:44:31.722 --> 00:44:32.990
We get these! Come on!

527
00:44:37.061 --> 00:44:39.497
Amid the coming calamity,

528
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.767
there will be parched lips,
and lots of dry throats.

529
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.535
But in the joy of today,

530
00:44:44.869 --> 00:44:47.171
- everything is pleasant.
- Move!

531
00:44:50.841 --> 00:44:53.144
As summer fades to winter...

532
00:44:54.612 --> 00:44:55.813
Let me take this!

533
00:44:55.846 --> 00:44:57.949
So Baihan's image will fade.

534
00:45:07.158 --> 00:45:08.159
This is not right.

535
00:45:08.726 --> 00:45:10.928
You're frightened.

536
00:45:11.896 --> 00:45:13.564
What the hell is
wrong with this city?

537
00:45:50.634 --> 00:45:54.205
By sacred order of
the great Lord Redmane,

538
00:45:54.238 --> 00:45:56.640
your heads are to
be swiftly removed.

539
00:46:05.883 --> 00:46:07.551
Move, run!

540
00:46:07.585 --> 00:46:09.520
We gotta get outta here!
We gotta get outta here!

541
00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:46.324
The car from yesterday,
you set that up?

542
00:46:47.091 --> 00:46:48.592
Your behavior was unacceptable.

543
00:46:49.394 --> 00:46:51.062
I guess you don't wanna
find your daughter.

544
00:46:53.398 --> 00:46:56.100
And she probably won't
wanna see you anyway.

545
00:46:56.133 --> 00:46:57.668
What would you know?

546
00:46:58.303 --> 00:46:59.970
You know nothing
about losing a child!

547
00:47:11.115 --> 00:47:13.651
What's your problem?

548
00:47:39.009 --> 00:47:40.010
Pull him out.

549
00:47:46.984 --> 00:47:47.785
Hey, Ling!

550
00:47:49.186 --> 00:47:50.187
Ling, stop!

551
00:47:52.857 --> 00:47:55.159
Daddy, come and find me!

552
00:47:55.192 --> 00:47:57.161
You can do it if you try!

553
00:47:57.194 --> 00:47:59.697
If not, the monster will get me!

554
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:01.866
Daddy will
beat the monster!

555
00:48:01.899 --> 00:48:03.335
And rescue you!

556
00:48:11.409 --> 00:48:12.377
I said pull him out!

557
00:48:18.849 --> 00:48:20.651
You're surprisingly tough.

558
00:48:22.987 --> 00:48:24.289
I won't die.

559
00:48:24.822 --> 00:48:26.291
I'll bring Tangerine home.

560
00:48:27.057 --> 00:48:28.326
She's waiting for me.

561
00:48:36.734 --> 00:48:37.701
Good evening, sir.

562
00:48:37.735 --> 00:48:39.404
This is
the front desk calling.

563
00:48:39.437 --> 00:48:41.205
There's a Mr. Lu
here looking for you.

564
00:48:44.442 --> 00:48:45.843
Tell him I'll be right down.

565
00:48:50.147 --> 00:48:50.981
You dropped this.

566
00:48:53.851 --> 00:48:55.453
Your key card was inside,
that's how I found you.

567
00:49:05.796 --> 00:49:07.299
How about we go for a walk,

568
00:49:07.332 --> 00:49:08.766
and you tell me more
about your story.

569
00:49:21.178 --> 00:49:22.112
So did you read it?

570
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:25.350
Uh?

571
00:49:26.551 --> 00:49:28.752
- Read what?
- Godslayer, dude!

572
00:49:28.786 --> 00:49:30.355
I updated the story last night.

573
00:49:33.824 --> 00:49:35.059
It's not loading.

574
00:49:35.092 --> 00:49:36.494
Oh, your phone's
a piece of junk!

575
00:49:38.095 --> 00:49:39.897
My words were
flowing last night,

576
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:41.299
all thanks to your
little notebook.

577
00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:42.534
It really inspired me.

578
00:49:42.567 --> 00:49:44.101
- So, thanks.
- You're welcome.

579
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:47.171
My little notebook?

580
00:49:47.204 --> 00:49:50.508
Wait, why were you
reading my notebook?

581
00:49:50.542 --> 00:49:53.177
Oh man, I know I
should've asked first.

582
00:49:53.978 --> 00:49:57.181
But I've been stuck in this rut
for so freaking long.

583
00:49:57.948 --> 00:50:00.050
Hey, those ideas you wrote
in your notebook,

584
00:50:00.552 --> 00:50:02.219
how did you come up with them?

585
00:50:02.254 --> 00:50:03.521
It's none of your business!

586
00:50:06.424 --> 00:50:07.791
I dreamt them, all right!

587
00:50:08.293 --> 00:50:10.495
Hey, just relax my friend,

588
00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:12.930
I didn't mean to
upset you, not at all.

589
00:50:14.332 --> 00:50:19.203
You know, in the past,
I wasn't such weird little nerd.

590
00:50:19.236 --> 00:50:20.405
I was really outgoing.

591
00:50:20.438 --> 00:50:21.539
Even had a girlfriend.

592
00:50:24.174 --> 00:50:24.975
But this one time,

593
00:50:28.112 --> 00:50:31.349
I read a story from the library.

594
00:50:33.585 --> 00:50:35.252
A book called Seesaw.

595
00:50:36.421 --> 00:50:37.921
And it really touched me, man.

596
00:50:39.957 --> 00:50:41.892
That's how I fell in
love with stories.

597
00:50:43.295 --> 00:50:44.795
And once I started writing,

598
00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:48.966
it was like nothing else
really mattered to me.

599
00:50:49.634 --> 00:50:51.001
Nothing at all.

600
00:50:52.337 --> 00:50:53.338
That's enough.

601
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:54.905
Let's go.

602
00:50:54.938 --> 00:50:55.939
Huh?

603
00:50:57.908 --> 00:51:00.978
I kept writing
and writing and writing,

604
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:05.450
and by the time I realized it,
my girlfriend had left.

605
00:51:06.284 --> 00:51:11.155
My diploma had been
canceled, and I couldn't get a job.

606
00:51:13.023 --> 00:51:14.024
But I felt fine.

607
00:51:14.459 --> 00:51:16.026
I had my story to write.

608
00:51:17.362 --> 00:51:19.029
Though I felt bad for my mother.

609
00:51:19.664 --> 00:51:22.367
It's been six years since then.

610
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:26.036
Six years?

611
00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:28.540
Yeah, and it doesn't
exactly pay well.

612
00:51:31.008 --> 00:51:32.076
I live off my mother.

613
00:51:33.678 --> 00:51:36.381
Six years and you
still haven't made it?

614
00:51:36.414 --> 00:51:39.049
Just stop writing!

615
00:51:40.117 --> 00:51:41.353
It's hopeless.

616
00:51:43.555 --> 00:51:45.089
No matter what
people say about me,

617
00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:51.329
I always believe I can do it.

618
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:59.371
As long as I keep writing,
my existence has meaning.

619
00:52:08.346 --> 00:52:09.514
Did you hear that?

620
00:52:14.251 --> 00:52:15.052
Did you?

621
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:26.531
Uh, uh...

622
00:52:33.471 --> 00:52:36.974
On a deserted street,
Kongwen recklessly chased

623
00:52:37.007 --> 00:52:38.075
the crimson cavalrymen.

624
00:52:39.243 --> 00:52:42.012
The talking armor hasn't
spoken in a while.

625
00:52:42.045 --> 00:52:44.282
Maybe it's fallen asleep.

626
00:52:51.088 --> 00:52:52.923
Come on, let's go home.

627
00:52:53.391 --> 00:52:54.526
You're so heavy!

628
00:52:59.631 --> 00:53:00.632
Go away!

629
00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.308
Go away!

630
00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:20.552
It's too late.

631
00:53:23.254 --> 00:53:24.255
He's already dead.

632
00:53:29.794 --> 00:53:31.028
Is this your brother?

633
00:53:31.596 --> 00:53:32.497
You could say that.

634
00:53:37.669 --> 00:53:40.137
Gifts left behind by the dead,
we'll trade them for food.

635
00:53:43.541 --> 00:53:44.342
Oh.

636
00:53:45.543 --> 00:53:48.546
Those cavalrymen, who were they?

637
00:53:49.246 --> 00:53:52.082
When they blew their horns,
why did everyone run away?

638
00:53:53.418 --> 00:53:55.185
You're not from
around here, are you?

639
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:58.723
No wonder.

640
00:53:58.756 --> 00:54:01.158
Those are Lord Redmane's
personal troops.

641
00:54:01.191 --> 00:54:03.628
When there's no fighting,
a curfew is imposed.

642
00:54:03.828 --> 00:54:06.397
They come out and blow their
horns before sunset.

643
00:54:06.798 --> 00:54:09.334
After dark, no one
is allowed out.

644
00:54:11.201 --> 00:54:12.337
What happens if they do?

645
00:54:13.671 --> 00:54:14.672
They get killed.

646
00:54:20.345 --> 00:54:23.314
If not for you, I would've
died 10 times over.

647
00:55:04.154 --> 00:55:07.659
This crimson stuff,
I can't see anything.

648
00:55:08.826 --> 00:55:09.827
Little girl.

649
00:55:24.609 --> 00:55:25.208
What's wrong?

650
00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:28.313
This is bad. The sun.

651
00:55:29.314 --> 00:55:30.481
The sun?

652
00:55:30.915 --> 00:55:32.450
I forgot the time.

653
00:55:53.404 --> 00:55:54.405
Don't worry.

654
00:55:56.239 --> 00:55:57.609
Come on!

655
00:56:19.764 --> 00:56:21.599
This way, quickly!

656
00:56:23.568 --> 00:56:25.436
This way.

657
00:56:33.210 --> 00:56:34.312
Over here, come on.

658
00:56:37.682 --> 00:56:38.516
Keep going!

659
00:56:47.959 --> 00:56:49.594
- It's a dead end!
- Huh?

660
00:56:54.265 --> 00:56:55.633
Up, to the roof!

661
00:56:59.737 --> 00:57:00.538
Come on.

662
00:57:03.341 --> 00:57:04.375
Get up!

663
00:57:12.316 --> 00:57:13.317
Come on!

664
00:57:21.292 --> 00:57:22.694
I'm just slowing you down!

665
00:58:04.068 --> 00:58:05.837
Here! Over here!

666
00:58:06.938 --> 00:58:07.805
Come on, hurry up.

667
00:59:36.093 --> 00:59:37.061
Stop!

668
00:59:52.143 --> 00:59:53.477
Run away!

669
01:00:28.779 --> 01:00:31.015
Run!

670
01:00:31.215 --> 01:00:33.918
Come on!

671
01:00:58.743 --> 01:01:01.579
Do you hear it?

672
01:01:05.216 --> 01:01:06.050
There it is again.

673
01:01:07.685 --> 01:01:08.686
Guan Ning?

674
01:01:10.788 --> 01:01:11.923
Guan Ning?

675
01:01:24.936 --> 01:01:25.937
Guan Ning!

676
01:01:27.004 --> 01:01:28.139
Guan Ning!

677
01:01:33.077 --> 01:01:34.211
Help me, Guan Ning!

678
01:02:24.895 --> 01:02:26.197
My Little Tangerine.

679
01:02:26.897 --> 01:02:28.566
How beautiful are you.

680
01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.069
All of my love
belongs just to you.

681
01:02:32.703 --> 01:02:36.073

Where did you hear that song?

703
01:03:40.071 --> 01:03:42.706
Huh? Tell me, tell me!

704
01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.309
Where did you learn that song?
Tell me!

705
01:03:44.342 --> 01:03:46.210
Tell me where you heard the
song! Tell me!

706
01:04:46.971 --> 01:04:47.872
It is you!

707
01:04:50.207 --> 01:04:51.242
Oh, damn it!

708
01:04:54.412 --> 01:04:55.913
Get him.

709
01:04:56.947 --> 01:04:57.915
Get him!

710
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:04.256
Hey, give me my balls!

711
01:05:57.875 --> 01:05:58.842
Bastard!

712
01:05:59.843 --> 01:06:00.878
You bastard!

713
01:06:10.888 --> 01:06:13.190
Bastard!

714
01:06:15.059 --> 01:06:17.228
Stop!

715
01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:20.130
Stop, stop, stop. Please!

716
01:06:21.065 --> 01:06:22.400
Where is my daughter?

717
01:06:28.306 --> 01:06:29.407
Where is my daughter?

718
01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.309
Tangerine?

719
01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:34.144
Little Tangerine?

720
01:06:35.012 --> 01:06:37.047
Yes, yes.

721
01:06:37.515 --> 01:06:39.783
Tangerine, Little Tangerine.

722
01:06:41.386 --> 01:06:43.087
Tell me where she is!

723
01:06:43.421 --> 01:06:45.889
Man, just listen to me.

724
01:06:46.258 --> 01:06:47.925
I didn't do it on purpose.

725
01:06:49.193 --> 01:06:54.399
But I put your kid in a sack
and locked her in the trunk.

726
01:06:55.267 --> 01:06:59.371
I... I was scared that she'd
make noise, so I drugged her.

727
01:07:01.171 --> 01:07:02.474
That was my first time.

728
01:07:03.475 --> 01:07:04.975
I was an amateur.

729
01:07:05.009 --> 01:07:07.177
I didn't know the right dose.

730
01:07:09.347 --> 01:07:12.350
So I gave her too much.

731
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:17.921
When I checked on her later,
she didn't...

732
01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:20.292
she didn't wake up.

733
01:07:23.328 --> 01:07:24.962
This is rain, you know?

734
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:26.830
It's called rain.

735
01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:30.000
Yeah, it's raining.

736
01:07:31.869 --> 01:07:33.871
You haven't played
in the rain before.

737
01:07:34.204 --> 01:07:35.473
You wanna try?

738
01:07:35.507 --> 01:07:37.342
Yeah, let's go!

739
01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:38.876
I really didn't mean to.

740
01:07:39.877 --> 01:07:42.046
Listen, I have money, really.

741
01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:44.048
I... I can pay you, man, I swear.

742
01:07:44.081 --> 01:07:45.215
I'll pay you!

743
01:08:22.287 --> 01:08:24.054
- Hey, did you see that?
- Oh my gosh.

744
01:08:24.955 --> 01:08:26.890
Damn, who
are those guys?

745
01:08:26.924 --> 01:08:27.991
Oh, they got messed up.

746
01:08:28.192 --> 01:08:29.527
Go to the hotel.

747
01:08:29.561 --> 01:08:31.296
I'm gonna kill him.

748
01:08:31.329 --> 01:08:33.163
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Move!

749
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:52.684
He's awake.

750
01:08:52.717 --> 01:08:54.084
Take care of Guan Ning.

751
01:08:54.719 --> 01:08:55.986
We're gonna need him.

752
01:09:02.727 --> 01:09:06.897
Changhai Yu said..
.my daughter is dead.

753
01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:08.366
He must be mistaken.

754
01:09:10.402 --> 01:09:11.935
Or he's lying.

755
01:09:11.969 --> 01:09:13.070
You have to be firm.

756
01:09:13.103 --> 01:09:14.305
You must reassure him.

757
01:09:15.473 --> 01:09:17.007
Those five girls,

758
01:09:18.643 --> 01:09:20.110
was any of them my daughter?

759
01:09:32.222 --> 01:09:33.223
There's no hope.

760
01:09:36.461 --> 01:09:37.629
There never was.

761
01:09:40.732 --> 01:09:42.700
You're in a fragile
emotional state.

762
01:09:43.535 --> 01:09:46.236
I'll get someone
else to do this.

763
01:09:47.305 --> 01:09:48.105
You should stand down.

764
01:09:49.541 --> 01:09:51.108
Ling, what did you say?

765
01:09:51.776 --> 01:09:53.243
We can't let him go!

766
01:09:53.578 --> 01:09:55.313
We need him to kill Kongwen!

767
01:09:57.649 --> 01:09:59.551
Where's Changhai Yu?

768
01:09:59.584 --> 01:10:00.351
We have him.

769
01:10:01.352 --> 01:10:03.321
I'll find a way to turn him
into the police.

770
01:10:03.755 --> 01:10:05.390
He'll get the
punishment he deserves.

771
01:10:06.491 --> 01:10:07.292
Punishment?

772
01:10:10.227 --> 01:10:12.430
Then just hand him over to me,
not to the police!

773
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:16.200
One life in exchange
for another.

774
01:10:16.668 --> 01:10:18.135
That was our deal.

775
01:10:19.304 --> 01:10:22.206
I'll give you Kongwen's life
if you give me Changhai's!

776
01:10:24.742 --> 01:10:27.244
Tomorrow's our last
chance. I'll call you.

777
01:10:54.839 --> 01:10:57.575
Just now, you really
wanted to let him go.

778
01:10:58.710 --> 01:10:59.777
Those five girls...

779
01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:04.482
- they were all fake, weren't they?
- Of course.

780
01:11:05.082 --> 01:11:07.251
Guan Ning spent six years trying
to find his daughter.

781
01:11:07.285 --> 01:11:08.753
How do you think
I could find her?

782
01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:10.220
You used his dead daughter.

783
01:11:11.121 --> 01:11:12.524
You're feeling sorry for him?

784
01:11:13.391 --> 01:11:16.159
Did you forget that Ning
is just like your parents?

785
01:11:16.193 --> 01:11:17.729
He threw his kid
away like garbage.

786
01:11:17.762 --> 01:11:19.364
Discarded and misplaced.

787
01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:21.466
You were discarded as well.

788
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.269
And you feel sorry for him?

789
01:11:27.572 --> 01:11:29.374
Why must
Ning kill Kongwen?

790
01:11:29.407 --> 01:11:31.342
It has to be him!
It's essential!

791
01:11:49.159 --> 01:11:50.528
Come, come!

792
01:11:51.563 --> 01:11:54.097
Long ago,
the emperor had two generals

793
01:11:54.131 --> 01:11:55.533
that were his favorites.

794
01:11:56.199 --> 01:11:59.202
One was called Redmane,
the other, Jiutian.

795
01:11:59.236 --> 01:12:00.405
They were sworn brothers.

796
01:12:01.906 --> 01:12:04.542
But for a long time,
the emperor didn't attend court.

797
01:12:04.576 --> 01:12:06.844
And Redmane ruled on
important matters.

798
01:12:07.512 --> 01:12:09.347
People said the
emperor was dead.

799
01:12:09.581 --> 01:12:11.683
Redmane had them
rounded up and beheaded.

800
01:12:13.284 --> 01:12:14.786
After Jiutian heard,

801
01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:17.422
he returned with his soldiers
to see the emperor.

802
01:12:18.856 --> 01:12:22.694
Redmane said to Jiutian,
"Go home, my good brother.

803
01:12:22.727 --> 01:12:24.762
Obey me and I'll make
you prime minister."

804
01:12:25.863 --> 01:12:29.367
Jiutian refused,
and started a fight with Redmane.

805
01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.635
What happened then?

806
01:12:30.668 --> 01:12:33.471
Jiutian was killed
and declared a traitor.

807
01:12:33.504 --> 01:12:35.273
His clan was wiped out.

808
01:12:36.708 --> 01:12:39.310
Redmane resented the citizens
who helped Jiutian.

809
01:12:39.344 --> 01:12:42.447
So he turned the 18 districts
against each other.

810
01:12:44.181 --> 01:12:47.318
Time passed, and it
turned into a war.

811
01:12:47.352 --> 01:12:50.488
Whenever fighting starts,
Redmane lets off fireworks.

812
01:12:51.221 --> 01:12:52.423
I guess he likes war.

813
01:12:57.729 --> 01:12:59.731
Dad? Mom?

814
01:13:00.431 --> 01:13:01.432
I'm home.

815
01:13:09.641 --> 01:13:13.176
A few years ago,
my parents went out for food,

816
01:13:13.678 --> 01:13:15.313
and must have missed the curfew.

817
01:13:17.214 --> 01:13:18.181
They never came back.

818
01:13:23.253 --> 01:13:23.855
My dad painted that.

819
01:13:24.288 --> 01:13:25.456
My mom in her childhood.

820
01:13:26.257 --> 01:13:27.291
It's truly beautiful!

821
01:13:28.259 --> 01:13:30.428
Art was the most
precious thing in Baihan.

822
01:13:30.895 --> 01:13:32.764
All of the paintings
in the district were looted.

823
01:13:34.365 --> 01:13:35.767
It'll be light soon.

824
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.702
They'll come to take
my mom's paintings

825
01:13:38.235 --> 01:13:39.470
and kill me as well.

826
01:13:39.971 --> 01:13:41.339
Run away with me.

827
01:13:41.839 --> 01:13:43.173
There's nowhere to run.

828
01:13:43.508 --> 01:13:44.642
The world belongs to Redmane.

829
01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:51.649
Kill them all! Wipe them out!

830
01:13:52.383 --> 01:13:53.718
The door's locked!

831
01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:55.286
- Over the hedge!
- The hedge!

832
01:14:00.925 --> 01:14:02.627
Go on, open the gate!

833
01:14:07.331 --> 01:14:08.700
- This way!
- Over here.

834
01:14:08.733 --> 01:14:10.668
Search the place.
Look for paintings!

835
01:14:10.702 --> 01:14:13.638
I got another one!
Hey, it looks sweet too.

836
01:14:14.372 --> 01:14:16.441
- There's nothing left!
- Not a piece!

837
01:14:20.278 --> 01:14:21.879
- Damn it!
- Just give up already!

838
01:14:21.913 --> 01:14:23.748
There's nothing,
someone's been here.

839
01:14:23.781 --> 01:14:25.783
Let's kill these two brats
and be on our way.

840
01:14:30.321 --> 01:14:32.356
I won't let you tie
my head to a tree!

841
01:14:53.811 --> 01:14:55.580
Let's just
kill them already!

842
01:14:55.613 --> 01:14:57.281
No, no, no, really?

843
01:14:57.315 --> 01:14:59.584
Is this how you're going to die?

844
01:14:59.617 --> 01:15:00.752
How boring.

845
01:15:11.696 --> 01:15:13.464
Hello?

846
01:15:13.865 --> 01:15:15.500
It's Ning Guan, where are you?

847
01:15:18.603 --> 01:15:19.904
You were
right yesterday.

848
01:15:21.105 --> 01:15:27.612
I have been... writing for many
years without any success.

849
01:15:28.813 --> 01:15:29.914
And
at the expense of my mother.

850
01:15:31.115 --> 01:15:31.916
I've been too reckless.

851
01:15:33.985 --> 01:15:36.587
Yesterday, some madman was
throwing rocks at me

852
01:15:36.621 --> 01:15:38.890
and I thought... I
thought I was gonna die.

853
01:15:40.825 --> 01:15:44.762
I-I-I could hear my heart racing
in my chest.

854
01:15:45.563 --> 01:15:46.798
And it was so clear.

855
01:15:47.999 --> 01:15:53.304
For a moment I thought that
maybe dying would be easier,

856
01:15:53.538 --> 01:15:55.873
so much easier than all this.

857
01:15:55.907 --> 01:15:58.943
I'd be at ease,
and my story would be done.

858
01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:04.081
I get it.

859
01:16:07.685 --> 01:16:08.986
We live our lives hoping.

860
01:16:11.722 --> 01:16:16.394
But that hope,
it's just a dream.

861
01:16:16.427 --> 01:16:17.795
Just
think of my father.

862
01:16:18.462 --> 01:16:21.933
One day, he was fine,
and gone the next.

863
01:16:24.735 --> 01:16:26.704
If somebody pushed
me off right now,

864
01:16:28.639 --> 01:16:30.641
it would solve everything.

865
01:16:33.678 --> 01:16:35.479
I would sincerely
thank that person.

866
01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:44.989
Unfortunately,
I still haven't finished...

867
01:16:45.623 --> 01:16:46.791
writing your character.

868
01:16:53.831 --> 01:16:54.999
Uh...

869
01:16:55.766 --> 01:16:56.901
What do you mean by that?

870
01:16:58.903 --> 01:17:00.504
I told you about him already,

871
01:17:00.705 --> 01:17:02.473
I got the idea
from your notebook,

872
01:17:02.506 --> 01:17:05.610
the warrior with something...
crimson on his head.

873
01:17:05.643 --> 01:17:07.144
It's bothering me.

874
01:17:07.178 --> 01:17:08.546
I can't see anything.

875
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:14.118
That was so cool, that I put you
in the story, yesterday.

876
01:17:15.686 --> 01:17:16.921
I did write it in a hurry,

877
01:17:16.954 --> 01:17:18.756
but it was all inspired
by your notebook.

878
01:17:19.857 --> 01:17:23.594
Well, technically speaking,
it wasn't you I wrote.

879
01:17:24.495 --> 01:17:27.798
It's more like a
crimson warrior...

880
01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:32.203
that grew from deep within you.

881
01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:47.785
Run!

882
01:17:55.726 --> 01:17:57.962
And the wound,
the one on the warrior's head

883
01:17:58.996 --> 01:18:00.665
it's exactly the same as yours.

884
01:18:01.065 --> 01:18:02.466
It's practically Identical.

885
01:18:11.876 --> 01:18:12.910
From what you wrote,

886
01:18:14.612 --> 01:18:17.982
the warrior doesn't seem to be
going after Kongwen.

887
01:18:18.582 --> 01:18:19.817
Is it the girl he is after?

888
01:18:20.618 --> 01:18:23.654
I think he was after
the girl's flute.

889
01:18:23.688 --> 01:18:24.555
A flute?

890
01:18:25.756 --> 01:18:26.958
Yeah, I don't know.

891
01:18:26.991 --> 01:18:29.493
But the warrior,
he was enchanted

892
01:18:29.527 --> 01:18:32.163
by Tangerine's flute playing,
it called to him.

893
01:18:39.737 --> 01:18:40.738
Tangerine?

894
01:18:41.772 --> 01:18:43.040
What'd you mean, Tangerine?

895
01:18:43.874 --> 01:18:45.643
The girl in the story.

896
01:18:46.544 --> 01:18:47.244
A ten-year-old girl.

897
01:18:48.879 --> 01:18:49.947
The one from Baihan Fang.

898
01:18:50.982 --> 01:18:52.249
The one who lost her parents.

899
01:19:00.992 --> 01:19:03.027
Every time this
Redmane gets sick or hurt,

900
01:19:03.561 --> 01:19:05.196
my boss faints like today.

901
01:19:05.896 --> 01:19:07.898
That's the third time now.

902
01:19:07.932 --> 01:19:10.568
I guess the one in
Baihan isn't interesting enough.

903
01:19:10.601 --> 01:19:12.069
So I wrote you into the story.

904
01:19:12.103 --> 01:19:13.037
And because of your dream,

905
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:14.473
my boss has determined
it's you.

906
01:19:14.505 --> 01:19:17.141
- He thinks it's fate.
- I'll bring Tangerine home.

907
01:19:17.174 --> 01:19:18.809
She's waiting for me.

908
01:19:19.577 --> 01:19:21.812
Daddy,
come and find me!

909
01:19:21.846 --> 01:19:23.281
You can if you try!

910
01:19:23.315 --> 01:19:25.816
If not, the monster will get me!

911
01:19:26.684 --> 01:19:28.819
Daddy, come and find me!

912
01:19:28.853 --> 01:19:30.588
You can if you try!

913
01:19:30.621 --> 01:19:33.325
If not,
the monster will get me!

914
01:19:41.132 --> 01:19:44.602
Your story, can it
alter our reality?

915
01:19:44.969 --> 01:19:45.936
That's a
strange question.

916
01:19:46.937 --> 01:19:49.140
A story changing reality?

917
01:19:50.141 --> 01:19:51.142
I don't know.

918
01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:56.013
But I do believe that the
story's world and people...

919
01:19:57.014 --> 01:19:59.317
do exist in another world.

920
01:20:00.718 --> 01:20:05.723
They're just like
us, living, you know?

921
01:20:08.626 --> 01:20:10.262
Although they evaded
the crimson warrior,

922
01:20:11.662 --> 01:20:14.098
Kongwen and Tangerine were
surrounded by a mob.

923
01:20:15.633 --> 01:20:16.600
How are they going to escape?

924
01:20:22.139 --> 01:20:23.841
Well, you're the one writing it.

925
01:20:24.342 --> 01:20:26.010
So you can decide
what happens next.

926
01:20:29.414 --> 01:20:33.050
Tell me. That strange talking armor
thing, whose side is it on?

927
01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:37.254
The armor feeds on
Kongwen's blood.

928
01:20:38.089 --> 01:20:38.923
Which means they have a...

929
01:20:40.292 --> 01:20:42.626
- they have a weird symbiosis.
- That's clear.

930
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.936
I... I got it!

931
01:21:31.343 --> 01:21:32.843
They're
gonna kill Tangerine

932
01:21:33.944 --> 01:21:35.380
and take her parents' paintings.

933
01:21:37.114 --> 01:21:38.883
Your heart is racing, young man.

934
01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:42.086
I'll kill anyone who lays
a hand on this girl.

935
01:21:42.119 --> 01:21:43.988
Ah yes,
the taste of blood.

936
01:21:49.394 --> 01:21:52.163
Kill them and hang
their heads on a tree!

937
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:12.950
Cockroaches.

938
01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.689
Come, let me crush you.

939
01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:57.895
Run, Tangerine!

940
01:23:23.355 --> 01:23:24.356
My meatball!

941
01:23:59.223 --> 01:24:00.224
Huh?

942
01:24:12.337 --> 01:24:13.338
Stop!

943
01:24:17.041 --> 01:24:17.841
Enough!

944
01:24:23.281 --> 01:24:24.282
Hurry!

945
01:24:25.049 --> 01:24:26.384
Run!

946
01:24:41.366 --> 01:24:42.166
It's you.

947
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:53.478
Huh?

948
01:25:04.289 --> 01:25:05.290
Huh?

949
01:25:06.524 --> 01:25:09.294
No, no, no, no, no.

950
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:13.498
No.

951
01:25:13.997 --> 01:25:15.165
Impossible.

952
01:25:16.668 --> 01:25:18.336
How could it... what is this?

953
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:26.411
Get up.

954
01:25:29.213 --> 01:25:31.148
Are you okay? Huh?

955
01:25:37.187 --> 01:25:38.323
Are you done yet?

956
01:25:38.356 --> 01:25:39.324
I've had enough!

957
01:25:51.569 --> 01:25:52.570
What are you sighing for?

958
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:54.305
I really...

959
01:25:57.007 --> 01:25:58.008
What the...?

960
01:26:00.311 --> 01:26:04.114
Hey. Uh, uh, no, please.

961
01:26:06.016 --> 01:26:11.322
I didn't think that you would
be so mean!

962
01:26:16.226 --> 01:26:17.395
What else do you want?

963
01:26:17.429 --> 01:26:18.563
Kneel.

964
01:26:18.596 --> 01:26:20.698
Never!

965
01:26:26.304 --> 01:26:28.506
For 400 years,

966
01:26:29.641 --> 01:26:35.313
I never expected that a mortal
would control me!

967
01:26:38.583 --> 01:26:40.385
You drank too much of my blood.

968
01:26:40.418 --> 01:26:42.420
So what? Your blood is tasty!

969
01:26:42.454 --> 01:26:44.188
I've held back for 400 years.

970
01:26:50.762 --> 01:26:52.029
Bastard!

971
01:26:52.397 --> 01:26:53.598
Bastard!

972
01:26:54.299 --> 01:26:57.034
You are a bastard!

973
01:27:08.513 --> 01:27:11.014
Hey, Ling, I know
you're listening in.

974
01:27:11.048 --> 01:27:12.182
I'm not doing this.

975
01:27:12.817 --> 01:27:14.652
I'm not gonna let Kongwen die.

976
01:27:15.286 --> 01:27:18.088
After his story is done,
I'll turn myself in.

977
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:23.093
Tangerine, wherever you are,
even if you can't come back,

978
01:27:23.126 --> 01:27:24.596
even if you're
only in the story,

979
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:25.430
I will make you live on.

980
01:27:27.499 --> 01:27:28.766
Who
on earth are you?

981
01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.602
I've come to kill Redmane.

982
01:27:34.472 --> 01:27:37.342
I know how to get there,
to the mountain palace.

983
01:27:37.742 --> 01:27:39.176
I'll take you there.

984
01:28:05.436 --> 01:28:07.037
You're
so full of ideas.

985
01:28:07.572 --> 01:28:09.206
Perhaps you could
do me a favor

986
01:28:09.239 --> 01:28:11.241
and help me finish the story.

987
01:28:11.276 --> 01:28:12.377
You'll be the first to read it.

988
01:28:15.112 --> 01:28:16.748
- Huh?
- This guy.

989
01:28:18.349 --> 01:28:19.350
My dad.

990
01:28:20.752 --> 01:28:22.453
- I mean the man that's next to him.
- That's a friend of my dad's.

991
01:28:22.487 --> 01:28:24.121
Is that the...

992
01:28:24.154 --> 01:28:27.458
Oh well, that's
the famous Mu Li.

993
01:28:27.492 --> 01:28:28.593
They went to medical
school together.

994
01:28:29.294 --> 01:28:31.629
My dad founded a
company with him.

995
01:28:32.764 --> 01:28:34.499
Then one day they
were in an accident.

996
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.834
And my dad died.

997
01:28:47.445 --> 01:28:49.714
Take a break.
Let's find somewhere quiet.

998
01:28:52.784 --> 01:28:54.619
You knew Kongwen.

999
01:28:54.652 --> 01:28:56.186
He's your business
partner's son.

1000
01:28:56.219 --> 01:28:57.455
Why'd you hide that from me?

1001
01:28:57.488 --> 01:28:58.823
How did his father die?

1002
01:28:59.357 --> 01:29:00.792
What else are you
keeping from me?

1003
01:29:01.693 --> 01:29:04.562
I didn't tell
you for your own good.

1004
01:29:04.596 --> 01:29:06.564
Do you really
believe his story can kill you?

1005
01:29:06.598 --> 01:29:08.533
- Or you just wanna kill them all?
- I believe in karma.

1006
01:29:09.567 --> 01:29:11.369
After Kongwen and Guan Ning,

1007
01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:13.571
I'm next, right?

1008
01:29:16.441 --> 01:29:17.642
Then I quit, I'm done.

1009
01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:23.881
Mr. Li,
we checked a few days ago

1010
01:29:23.915 --> 01:29:26.149
and all of your
vitals were good.

1011
01:29:26.517 --> 01:29:28.353
Today, there are a
few abnormalities,

1012
01:29:28.386 --> 01:29:31.221
yet still within
the safe range.

1013
01:29:31.254 --> 01:29:32.290
If you're still
concerned about it,

1014
01:29:32.323 --> 01:29:34.359
then please come
back without delay,

1015
01:29:34.392 --> 01:29:35.760
and we'll do another
thorough check.

1016
01:29:44.936 --> 01:29:45.803
Ma'am, is this your car?

1017
01:29:46.604 --> 01:29:48.473
Please move it out of
the unloading zone!

1018
01:29:54.579 --> 01:29:56.748
Hey!

1019
01:30:10.294 --> 01:30:11.829
Pretty cool, huh?

1020
01:30:11.863 --> 01:30:14.298
There's a lithium battery
inside, really powerful current.

1021
01:30:14.332 --> 01:30:15.466
You wanna try it?

1022
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:16.834
I actually thought you were
generating power yourself.

1023
01:30:17.869 --> 01:30:19.370
You've seen too
many sci-fi movies.

1024
01:30:20.605 --> 01:30:22.807
I'm just a little harder to
electrocute than most people.

1025
01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:25.510
As a kid I was always
touching power sockets.

1026
01:30:25.543 --> 01:30:28.413
I'd charge myself and then shock
the girls at school!

1027
01:30:28.446 --> 01:30:30.815
It was so much fun!

1028
01:30:40.958 --> 01:30:43.261
I'm sorry for
bothering you again.

1029
01:30:43.294 --> 01:30:44.896
Oh, it's okay.

1030
01:30:44.929 --> 01:30:47.832
You can use this place
whenever you want.

1031
01:30:47.865 --> 01:30:49.300
- Just keep the key.
- Okay, thanks.

1032
01:31:06.784 --> 01:31:09.520
For some reason,
the path was not patrolled

1033
01:31:09.554 --> 01:31:12.290
by Redmane's guards,
as it should have been.

1034
01:31:13.291 --> 01:31:17.495
So, Tangerine and Kongwen
made it to the palace easily.

1035
01:31:20.598 --> 01:31:21.999
Don't risk your life, go home.

1036
01:31:22.867 --> 01:31:25.336
I've heard that
many who disappear end up

1037
01:31:25.369 --> 01:31:27.705
in the palace, as
disciples of Redmane.

1038
01:31:28.506 --> 01:31:30.441
My parents might be there.

1039
01:31:30.475 --> 01:31:31.676
I have to go and find them.

1040
01:31:56.701 --> 01:31:59.003
Kongwen, come back.

1041
01:32:20.358 --> 01:32:21.826
Kongwen! Kongwen!

1042
01:32:50.855 --> 01:32:52.824
I know why Redmane
has imposed a curfew.

1043
01:32:52.857 --> 01:32:54.325
His soldiers can't
move at night.

1044
01:32:55.026 --> 01:32:57.895
Redmane doesn't want people to
find out. Let's go.

1045
01:33:12.977 --> 01:33:14.412
I'm going down for a walk.

1046
01:33:14.912 --> 01:33:16.147
I'll be back soon.

1047
01:33:54.185 --> 01:33:55.720
Here!

1048
01:34:22.213 --> 01:34:25.149
Take that, and that!

1049
01:34:51.642 --> 01:34:53.177
Where is he, huh?

1050
01:34:53.210 --> 01:34:54.011
Where is he?

1051
01:34:56.247 --> 01:34:58.383
All right, let's
split up and search.

1052
01:35:04.289 --> 01:35:06.557
Still going forward?

1053
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:08.492
You must yearn for death.

1054
01:35:08.526 --> 01:35:09.961
Help me get vengeance.

1055
01:35:09.994 --> 01:35:11.696
When Redmane is dead,
I'll let you go.

1056
01:35:12.163 --> 01:35:13.831
Don't take
me for a fool.

1057
01:35:13.864 --> 01:35:16.033
I'm the one who
killed your sister.

1058
01:35:16.734 --> 01:35:18.102
My real
enemy is Redmane.

1059
01:35:18.736 --> 01:35:22.206
I already killed you once,
I have no hatred for you.

1060
01:35:23.607 --> 01:35:26.711
All along, I've treated
you as a friend.

1061
01:35:38.656 --> 01:35:40.157
Huh?

1062
01:35:59.643 --> 01:36:00.811
Come on, one more!

1063
01:36:00.845 --> 01:36:02.213
Come on, come on!

1064
01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:05.283
One more.

1065
01:36:05.317 --> 01:36:07.184
Huh? What happened?

1066
01:36:07.218 --> 01:36:09.287
Are you out? Come
on, look carefully.

1067
01:36:12.857 --> 01:36:14.925
I'll switch myself
to the highest current, then.

1068
01:36:15.726 --> 01:36:18.629
Oh, don't worry, you won't feel
a thing, I promise.

1069
01:36:19.597 --> 01:36:20.865
It feels good.

1070
01:36:20.898 --> 01:36:23.734
Come on, try it, come
on, come on. Huh?

1071
01:36:23.768 --> 01:36:25.303
Huh?

1072
01:36:38.883 --> 01:36:41.319
A rubber glove, a wooden floor.

1073
01:36:42.019 --> 01:36:43.054
Insulation.

1074
01:36:43.355 --> 01:36:46.190
How could you be so evil?

1075
01:36:55.966 --> 01:36:58.202
Kongwen,
the drumming is getting louder,

1076
01:36:59.703 --> 01:37:01.705
but there's no sight
of the drummer.

1077
01:37:04.975 --> 01:37:06.744
- Hey.
- What?

1078
01:37:07.244 --> 01:37:08.712
Armor, what does
Redmane look like?

1079
01:37:09.113 --> 01:37:10.348
No one
has ever seen him.

1080
01:37:11.182 --> 01:37:12.817
Go back.

1081
01:37:17.088 --> 01:37:19.056
Show yourself, Redmane!

1082
01:37:19.090 --> 01:37:20.057
You're scaring me.

1083
01:37:20.091 --> 01:37:21.092
I am Kongwen!

1084
01:37:22.427 --> 01:37:23.994
I've come to kill you!

1085
01:37:24.028 --> 01:37:25.062
There's no one home.

1086
01:37:25.096 --> 01:37:27.365
Take my advice and leave.

1087
01:37:32.837 --> 01:37:33.871
That's not drumming.

1088
01:37:39.311 --> 01:37:41.679
It's not drums.

1089
01:37:42.046 --> 01:37:43.180
It's his heartbeat.

1090
01:38:19.417 --> 01:38:21.051
I'm Redmane.

1091
01:38:42.206 --> 01:38:43.375
You damn fool!

1092
01:38:43.408 --> 01:38:44.909
Hey.

1093
01:38:53.784 --> 01:38:55.152
All right, that's enough.

1094
01:38:55.853 --> 01:38:57.988
Time to give up,
you need to go to a hospital.

1095
01:40:44.128 --> 01:40:44.928
Hey!

1096
01:41:29.507 --> 01:41:32.444
I recognize this face.

1097
01:41:39.684 --> 01:41:42.953
Unmistakably, it's
the same bloodline.

1098
01:41:43.621 --> 01:41:44.622
What do you mean?

1099
01:41:47.459 --> 01:41:48.593
You really don't know?

1100
01:41:50.094 --> 01:41:53.331
The year you were born,
I went to see you.

1101
01:41:54.031 --> 01:41:56.033
Your name is Kongwen.

1102
01:41:56.066 --> 01:42:00.104
You're the son of Jiutian,
he was my sworn brother!

1103
01:42:03.207 --> 01:42:06.311
From the start,
I should never have let you

1104
01:42:06.344 --> 01:42:08.112
and your sister live.

1105
01:42:09.381 --> 01:42:11.181
That is true karma!

1106
01:42:14.051 --> 01:42:15.185
But it's fine.

1107
01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:21.191
I've been alone for
way too long now.

1108
01:42:21.426 --> 01:42:22.627
This Jiutian you speak of,

1109
01:42:23.495 --> 01:42:24.496
my father...

1110
01:42:28.366 --> 01:42:30.033
You killed him too, right?

1111
01:42:31.369 --> 01:42:32.370
Huh?

1112
01:42:37.007 --> 01:42:40.412
I'll take you to
see your father.

1113
01:42:46.351 --> 01:42:49.454
Don't try to run away.

1114
01:42:50.355 --> 01:42:52.323
You can't escape.

1115
01:43:08.306 --> 01:43:09.106
Did you see that?

1116
01:43:10.341 --> 01:43:12.075
Between his eyebrows,
there was a sword stuck in there.

1117
01:43:15.012 --> 01:43:17.649
It seems Redmane
isn't so invincible.

1118
01:43:21.486 --> 01:43:22.287
Let's do it.

1119
01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.721
I'll cover you.

1120
01:43:25.022 --> 01:43:27.425
Here is your dear Father,

1121
01:43:27.459 --> 01:43:31.262
killed beneath this tree,
and buried here too.

1122
01:43:48.279 --> 01:43:53.351
Before I became a god,
he was my very best friend.

1123
01:43:54.552 --> 01:43:56.688
We fought battles
together,

1124
01:43:56.721 --> 01:44:00.090
drank together, we laughed.

1125
01:44:03.495 --> 01:44:05.195
I miss him.

1126
01:44:06.764 --> 01:44:07.765
You killed him!

1127
01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:14.004
Sadly, you mere mortals
could never escape

1128
01:44:14.204 --> 01:44:15.573
the grip of death.

1129
01:44:15.607 --> 01:44:17.509
It would bring me joy...

1130
01:44:19.544 --> 01:44:22.179
to kill him a few more times!

1131
01:44:29.253 --> 01:44:31.021
Tangerine, stay back.

1132
01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.094
How do we fight him?

1133
01:44:37.127 --> 01:44:38.429
Chop off his feet.

1134
01:44:44.869 --> 01:44:46.471
Go get him!

1135
01:45:27.745 --> 01:45:29.179
Watch out!

1136
01:46:50.261 --> 01:46:54.732
A mere mortal,
daring to slay a god?

1137
01:46:55.366 --> 01:46:56.567
You don't
deserve to be a person.

1138
01:46:58.336 --> 01:46:59.637
You're just a demon!

1139
01:47:00.237 --> 01:47:01.706
Go get him!

1140
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:08.178
When I held your
father in my hands,

1141
01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:11.214
he struggled for quite a while.

1142
01:47:12.016 --> 01:47:15.687
Now, I'm wondering,
how long can you last?

1143
01:47:30.802 --> 01:47:32.603
Let go of me!

1144
01:47:32.637 --> 01:47:34.472
Let go of me!

1145
01:47:39.043 --> 01:47:40.210
Meatball!

1146
01:48:09.407 --> 01:48:12.543
I shall kill you slowly.

1147
01:48:30.895 --> 01:48:33.831
Girl, what tune is that?

1148
01:48:34.932 --> 01:48:36.834
It's one my father taught me.

1149
01:48:37.101 --> 01:48:39.604
He said, whenever
I play this tune,

1150
01:48:40.571 --> 01:48:41.706
he will come to rescue me.

1151
01:48:46.444 --> 01:48:48.412
Your father lied to you.

1152
01:48:51.115 --> 01:48:53.785
Enough!

1153
01:48:54.585 --> 01:48:56.754
It's getting on my nerves!

1154
01:49:03.394 --> 01:49:04.428
Tangerine!

1155
01:50:07.892 --> 01:50:09.560
It's my fault, my fault.

1156
01:50:15.733 --> 01:50:16.901
The story is not done.

1157
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:19.937
I have to finish it.

1158
01:50:26.544 --> 01:50:28.412
Stay here
overnight for observation.

1159
01:50:39.991 --> 01:50:40.992
Sorry I'm late.

1160
01:50:42.093 --> 01:50:47.632
It seems that Kongwen,
I'm afraid he won't make it.

1161
01:50:50.668 --> 01:50:52.770
My original plan
was for the police

1162
01:50:53.204 --> 01:50:54.939
to think you'd killed yourself.

1163
01:50:54.972 --> 01:50:56.140
The police would
also have discovered

1164
01:50:56.807 --> 01:50:58.476
Tangerine's name in the story,

1165
01:50:59.543 --> 01:51:00.912
and that she's similar
to my daughter.

1166
01:51:00.945 --> 01:51:05.416
Also, remember the dream
diary you sent us?

1167
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:07.718
I forged your handwriting

1168
01:51:08.619 --> 01:51:09.921
and livened up your dreams.

1169
01:51:09.954 --> 01:51:11.589
That would prove
what I suspected,

1170
01:51:11.622 --> 01:51:13.691
Kongwen was linked to
Tangerine's disappearance.

1171
01:51:13.724 --> 01:51:14.792
That's why I wanted to kill him.

1172
01:51:16.761 --> 01:51:18.095
You hacked my phone,

1173
01:51:19.664 --> 01:51:21.933
so I couldn't read any of
the parts about her.

1174
01:51:21.966 --> 01:51:23.000
What a coincidence

1175
01:51:23.534 --> 01:51:26.203
that your daughter
is also Tangerine.

1176
01:51:26.237 --> 01:51:28.639
That's why you chose
me as the fall guy.

1177
01:51:28.906 --> 01:51:31.208
Once I died, the
case would be closed,

1178
01:51:31.809 --> 01:51:33.544
- and no one would suspect you.
- Yeah.

1179
01:51:34.578 --> 01:51:36.147
You two should leave now.

1180
01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:37.715
You'll get your compensation.

1181
01:51:37.748 --> 01:51:39.550
Five million each.

1182
01:51:39.583 --> 01:51:41.519
You think you can sweep
this under the rug,

1183
01:51:41.953 --> 01:51:44.221
but the death of Kongwen's
father will be enough

1184
01:51:44.255 --> 01:51:45.589
to bring you down.

1185
01:51:52.997 --> 01:51:54.031
Not happy?

1186
01:51:54.865 --> 01:51:56.033
Call the police.

1187
01:51:57.535 --> 01:51:58.703
We're accomplices, you know.

1188
01:51:59.804 --> 01:52:01.105
Do you wanna go down together?

1189
01:52:02.606 --> 01:52:03.808
Just let it go, okay?

1190
01:52:04.141 --> 01:52:05.142
Huh?

1191
01:52:06.210 --> 01:52:08.479
All right, I'll
need the computer.

1192
01:52:10.748 --> 01:52:14.085
- Guan Ning?
- Be quiet, I need to finish the story.

1193
01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:17.688
This a joke?

1194
01:52:17.955 --> 01:52:19.190
You don't know how to write.

1195
01:52:19.223 --> 01:52:20.925
All you can do is throw rocks.

1196
01:52:21.192 --> 01:52:24.829
I realize now, I wasn't
meant to kill him.

1197
01:52:26.331 --> 01:52:28.266
I'm here to help him
finish the story.

1198
01:52:29.233 --> 01:52:33.037
I had those dreams because
Tangerine was calling out to me

1199
01:52:33.671 --> 01:52:34.905
from the other world.

1200
01:52:35.106 --> 01:52:36.240
He's really lost it.

1201
01:52:36.907 --> 01:52:38.109
You've lost it.

1202
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:39.610
You think you can
write her back to life?

1203
01:52:39.944 --> 01:52:41.612
You don't have that power.

1204
01:52:41.645 --> 01:52:42.246
Yes, I do.

1205
01:52:46.217 --> 01:52:47.551
Because I believe.

1206
01:52:50.688 --> 01:52:52.123
You're insane!

1207
01:52:52.156 --> 01:52:53.157
Give it to me!

1208
01:52:56.694 --> 01:52:57.995
Wait, Ling!

1209
01:53:00.197 --> 01:53:02.900
I'm really curious
to see if this story

1210
01:53:02.933 --> 01:53:03.901
can write you to death.

1211
01:53:04.302 --> 01:53:06.070
My Little Tangerine.

1212
01:53:06.103 --> 01:53:08.039
All of my love
belongs just to you.

1213
01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.609
My Little Tangerine.

1214
01:53:12.977 --> 01:53:15.679
All of my love
belongs just to you.

1215
01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:19.050
You always make me smile.

1216
01:53:19.083 --> 01:53:20.985
I love, I love you.

1217
01:53:21.018 --> 01:53:22.287
I love you!

1218
01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.321
I love you.

1219
01:53:24.688 --> 01:53:29.193
I believe,
I believe that I can write this.

1220
01:53:40.104 --> 01:53:41.772
Give Tangerine back to me!

1221
01:54:01.125 --> 01:54:02.827
What a stubborn girl.

1222
01:54:03.395 --> 01:54:04.728
Tangerine!

1223
01:54:07.031 --> 01:54:08.599
It's useless.

1224
01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:11.635
No one is coming to save you.

1225
01:54:17.041 --> 01:54:19.643
How vain the hopes of mortals.

1226
01:54:39.797 --> 01:54:40.831
Tangerine!

1227
01:54:41.031 --> 01:54:42.300
Daddy's finally here!

1228
01:54:53.077 --> 01:54:56.914
Say hello to my little friend,
you big ape!

1229
01:54:58.483 --> 01:55:00.918
Daddy, I'm here!

1230
01:55:00.951 --> 01:55:03.053
Quick, save me!

1231
01:55:23.508 --> 01:55:25.709
That's right!
I'm taking you down!

1232
01:55:52.803 --> 01:55:54.205
Having fun?

1233
01:55:54.238 --> 01:55:56.040
Who's the boss now?

1234
01:56:00.312 --> 01:56:02.947
Tangerine, your dad really came.

1235
01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:09.321
Reloading.

1236
01:56:21.799 --> 01:56:24.168
In the name of my daughter,
I will punish you!

1237
01:56:39.250 --> 01:56:41.286
Human cannon power!

1238
01:57:01.972 --> 01:57:02.973
Huh?

1239
01:57:03.475 --> 01:57:04.808
The blade on his forehead!

1240
01:57:34.238 --> 01:57:35.273
You're alive?

1241
01:57:41.178 --> 01:57:43.080
Daddy!

1242
01:58:02.132 --> 01:58:03.200
Come on, I need to help him!

1243
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:06.538
Daddy!

1244
01:58:13.210 --> 01:58:14.211
Tangerine!

1245
01:58:15.079 --> 01:58:16.180
Daddy's here for you!

1246
01:59:38.696 --> 01:59:40.365
You can't pull it out!

1247
01:59:41.599 --> 01:59:43.233
Return my father's blade!

1248
01:59:50.775 --> 01:59:53.977
Return my father's blade!

1249
01:59:54.011 --> 01:59:55.280
I don't wanna die!

1250
01:59:57.482 --> 02:00:00.618
There's so much
more I have to do.

1251
02:00:00.652 --> 02:00:04.021
I need more time.

1252
02:00:06.624 --> 02:00:10.160
I can surpass everyone

1253
02:00:11.061 --> 02:00:14.432
and become a true god.

1254
02:00:14.632 --> 02:00:16.734
I am a god!

1255
02:00:17.134 --> 02:00:19.437
Beat the monster for me, Daddy!

1256
02:00:21.473 --> 02:00:24.375
Your wish is my command!

1257
02:01:03.848 --> 02:01:05.517
If my parents had been like you,

1258
02:01:06.584 --> 02:01:08.686
I would've never worked
for that monster.

1259
02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:10.053
The doctors
asked me to tell you

1260
02:01:10.087 --> 02:01:11.389
that Kongwen Lu is stable.

1261
02:01:14.592 --> 02:01:17.295
Mu,
the police are coming.

1262
02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:23.368
Guan Ning!

1263
02:01:24.569 --> 02:01:26.337
Dr. Lee,
please go to Emergency.

1264
02:01:26.371 --> 02:01:27.639
Dr. Lee,
please go to Emergency.

1265
02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:44.722
My Little Tangerine.

1266
02:01:45.623 --> 02:01:47.292
How beautiful are you.

1267
02:01:48.393 --> 02:01:51.296
All of my love
belongs just to you,

1268
02:01:51.329 --> 02:01:54.799
you're my Little Tangerine.

1269
02:01:55.533 --> 02:01:57.535
How beautiful are you.

1270
02:01:57.869 --> 02:02:00.338
You always make me smile.

1271
02:02:02.907 --> 02:02:04.709
I love, I love you!

1272
02:02:06.411 --> 02:02:08.379
Little Tangerine.

1273
02:02:08.413 --> 02:02:11.349
You are so lovely
and so beautiful.

1274
02:02:11.916 --> 02:02:16.186
Your love belongs to me because
you always make me smile.

1275
02:02:18.323 --> 02:02:21.593
Don't forget your dad loves you

1276
02:02:21.926 --> 02:02:23.193
and Mommy does too.

1277
02:02:33.271 --> 02:02:36.239
Daddy, what took you so long?

1278
02:02:38.241 --> 02:02:39.444
Daddy.

1279
02:02:51.856 --> 02:02:53.190
Daddy, don't cry.

1280
02:03:10.341 --> 02:03:12.175
Daddy,
let's go home.

1281
02:03:12.209 --> 02:03:13.378
Let's go home.

1282
02:05:39.624 --> 02:05:40.792
What time is it?
