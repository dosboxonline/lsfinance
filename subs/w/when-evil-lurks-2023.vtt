WEBVTT

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.074

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.615
Did you hear?

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:18.454
Is that our land?

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.498
No, it's in the forest.

00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:24.627
Maybe Ruiz?

00:01:26.712 --> 00:01:27.713
Or some poacher?

00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:30.257
No, a poacher
doesn't shoot so much.

00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:38.224
- Should we take the dogs?
- No, they'll see us.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.351
I counted three.

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:43.771
Then it stopped.
And two more.

00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:46.398
They are not hunting.

00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.235
It's not a rifle.

00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:51.904
It's a revolver.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.911
Get a coat.

00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:14.343
Was it here or at Ruiz's?

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:15.761
It was near.

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:37.283
We'll leave at dawn.

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:46.292
WHEN EVIL LURKS

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.130
Shit.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.477
A puma?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.398
There was a big one
stalking around.

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:36.819
It ate Ruiz's goats.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:43.534
Isn't this Ruiz?

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.078
He was hunting the puma.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.081
He lost to the cat.

00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:50.791
No.

00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:54.086
This guy was cut
with something sharp.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:02.678
What do we do?

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:04.138
We have to report it.

00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:21.780
These are pieces of something.

00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:28.954
I've seen this somewhere.

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:31.498
What is it for?

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.462
I don't know, brother.

00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.967
We are at Ruiz's now.

00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.636
We have to tell him.

00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:47.514
Or the police?

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:51.685
What if the killer is Ruiz?

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:53.812
He caught him stealing
and killed him.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:58.484
Ruiz wouldn't cut
someone in half, shut up.

00:05:59.985 --> 00:06:01.945
He cuts him up,
making him disappear,

00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.573
feeding him to the pigs...
- What happened with Ruiz?

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:05.574
Why?

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.702
Did something happen with Ruiz
that you are not telling me?

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:12.164
He doesn't like us.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.666
He doesn't like you!

00:06:27.096 --> 00:06:28.680
He was going...

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:30.599
or coming.

00:06:32.226 --> 00:06:34.645
He was taking a shortcut
to the hill.

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:37.022
To Maria Elena's house.

00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:39.024
Was he a relative?

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.194
What's this language?

00:06:43.695 --> 00:06:44.988
I've seen this.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.533
- Russian maybe?
- Russian?

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:50.953
Look, Maria Elena Gomez.

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:20.107
What's going on
with these dogs?

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:22.609
Hi, Maria Elena.

00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:24.570
How are you?

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.071
Long time no see.

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:28.615
We are here

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:31.118
about last night's gun shots,
did you hear them?

00:07:31.577 --> 00:07:34.079
We looked around
with Jimmy and the dogs,

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:35.914
nearby.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.834
We found someone
you may know.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.129
Were you waiting for someone?

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.799
Because he...

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:47.176
he won't make it.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.261
He had a problem.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.804
When will he arrive?

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:54.099
He must have arrived
long ago.

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:56.852
We are waiting for him.

00:07:57.227 --> 00:07:59.271
For him to deal
with my son.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:00.981
Uriel?

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.107
Yes.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:05.736
He has to kill my son.

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.865
He has to kill Uriel.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.857
He is possessed,

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:46.777
he's been rotten
for a long time.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.989
We were waiting for them
to dispose of him.

00:08:51.657 --> 00:08:53.325
It's my fault.

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.286
I thought that by praying

00:08:57.287 --> 00:08:59.039
we would be able to heal him.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.334
We lit a candle
to the Saint-

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.253
Churches are dead, ma'am.

00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.214
Dead.

00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:10.133
We were afraid of speaking.

00:09:10.676 --> 00:09:13.220
Afraid of getting kicked off the
land by Ruiz and the neighbors.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:14.763
We have nothing.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.932
We have no place to go.

00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:21.144
We thought we could heal him.

00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:24.231
We took care of him
so he didn't die.

00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:26.775
So they can kill him.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.903
But it's taking too long.

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:32.281
Have you reported this?

00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:35.075
A year ago, or more.

00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:36.285
A year?

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.246
Who did you tell?

00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:12.946
The lady's son?

00:10:13.739 --> 00:10:14.948
Yes, the older one.

00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:18.744
She didn't speak to me.
And to you, Superintendent?

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.789
Did you see him?

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:26.501
Well.

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:29.755
What did you see?

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.048
Tell me.

00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:33.133
Have you ever seen
a rotten before?

00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:34.801
So?

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.137
How do you know?

00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.057
As they say, Gutierrez,

00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:42.351
when you see one,
you know it.

00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:44.353
And we knew it, easy.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.022
You are under the influence.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:49.733
Many cases of possessed ones
are fake.

00:10:49.733 --> 00:10:51.443
And we are here,
in the middle of nowhere-

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:53.111
Uriel is dying!

00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:55.113
He is swollen,
he is a ball of pus.

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:56.948
Bring the Mayor.

00:10:56.948 --> 00:10:58.116
Give me the phone.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.910
Call him.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.454
Give me the number,
I'll do it, no problem.

00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:03.872
He must face this.

00:11:03.872 --> 00:11:05.415
Nobody tells me what to do.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.542
Especially you, Yazurlo.

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.044
Especially you.

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:10.712
It took a year.

00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:13.715
A whole year passed and you only
sent the cleaner yesterday.

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.425
Don't raise your voice.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.136
Nobody spoke to me about this.

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:21.431
You'll have a hard time, again.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:25.268
You don't believe me,
do you?

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:26.853
Leave him.

00:11:26.853 --> 00:11:28.730
Give me an excuse
to lock you up.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.358
You won't get out
easily, lunatic.

00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:32.901
Easy, brother.

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:35.320
We found the cleaner dead.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.532
We found him in pieces,
don't you get it?

00:11:38.824 --> 00:11:40.325
There's a protocol
for cases like this.

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:45.414
We call, Public Health comes
and they solve it.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:46.832
Done.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.126
That's what we'll do.

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:51.253
Do as you like.

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.048
Why was the cleaner killed?

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:57.426
Who?

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.302
Ruiz killed him?

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:01.304
Ruiz?

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.516
I doubt everything.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.935
We are at the end
of the world.

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:09.229
Why would there be
a possessed one here?

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:11.064
What are you saying?

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:15.235
They won't come
and see the body.

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:18.447
Not even the rotten,
they told me.

00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:22.200
They said
it's not their problem.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.494
They washed their hands.

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:28.081
But someone killed him, Ruiz.

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:30.375
Someone trying to prevent
the cleaner

00:12:30.375 --> 00:12:31.918
from reaching Maria's place.

00:12:34.045 --> 00:12:35.380
And the Mayor?

00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:37.048
They called him.

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:39.217
He knew, a year ago.

00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:41.511
He just let it pass.

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:44.806
He said he thought
it was already solved.

00:12:44.806 --> 00:12:46.391
They asked us not to speak,

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.352
or we'll be marked and
this place will be worthless.

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.146
A ghost town, Ruiz.

00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:52.397
We lose everything.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:56.276
They suggested we leave until
they send a new cleaner from...

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.111
the Ministry.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.196
When?

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:01.156
They didn't say.

00:13:01.156 --> 00:13:03.283
There's no time,
Uriel is about to die,

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.035
we can't wait for a cleaner.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:10.874
Leave,

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.918
close our mouths

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:14.336
and leave.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.171
We'll have to arm ourselves.

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.339
Arm ourselves?

00:13:17.923 --> 00:13:19.257
Against what?

00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:24.679
My dogs left a month ago.

00:13:26.056 --> 00:13:27.265
The four of them.

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:35.148
First they make
the animals go crazy, they say.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.278
Then they even make
the deceased crazy.

00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:43.532
What shall we do?

00:13:43.532 --> 00:13:46.034
Something, we have
to do something.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.620
Maybe we have
to auction everything off.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:51.289
Leave before this goes viral.

00:13:52.082 --> 00:13:53.333
The naive brothers.

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:57.420
This was a set up.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.922
It was the State.

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:00.549
They want my land.

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:03.969
That's why they abandon us,
they don't care about us.

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:07.097
A possessed one here.

00:14:08.598 --> 00:14:10.642
I never imagined this.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.198
Armando, where are you going?

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.659
Don't do something stupid.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.429
Holy Mary!

00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:48.597
Mr. Ruiz.

00:14:48.597 --> 00:14:51.057
God, what are you doing?

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:53.018
What are you doing?

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:57.564
Motherfuckers...

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.358
No,

00:15:02.027 --> 00:15:03.528
look what they brought.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:07.282
They brought the foulest thing
to my land.

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.450
Don't shoot.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.619
Mr. Ruiz,
don't shoot, please.

00:15:10.619 --> 00:15:12.579
I have to do it.

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:16.041
You don't kill evil like that,
it will be worse.

00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.043
If you kill him, you die.

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:22.589
It will take our bodies,
it will take our souls.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.301
Don't do it, please,
it will make it worse.

00:15:26.635 --> 00:15:27.469
Worse.

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:30.013
It has to be done
by a professional.

00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:32.140
Shut up, fucker.

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.644
I should have
burned your house down

00:15:35.644 --> 00:15:38.396
when you came here,
with your filth.

00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:40.315
You contaminate everything.

00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:41.650
Everything.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.068
Motherfuckers.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.778
Motherfuckers.

00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.198
Kill me, Ruiz.

00:15:49.407 --> 00:15:50.659
Please,

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.787
you coward, kill me.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:16:00.585
Before I move
to Jimena's belly,

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:04.839
and posses the life
growing inside of her.

00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:10.345
You'll be the first
I will visit

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:13.473
when I'm released.

00:16:43.294 --> 00:16:45.630
Armando.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:49.300
What have you done?
Tell me you didn't hurt anybody.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.553
He's playing, that's all.

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.723
He can do what he wants,
He plays with us.

00:16:54.723 --> 00:16:55.765
Open the window.

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:57.475
He taunts us.

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.601
Armando.

00:16:59.144 --> 00:17:01.187
He is alive,
he didn't do it.

00:17:02.647 --> 00:17:03.732
You have to leave.

00:17:03.732 --> 00:17:05.650
We are thinking about leaving.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.402
Fuck everything, Ruiz.

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:09.863
No, he has to go.

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:12.824
We have to take him away.

00:17:13.742 --> 00:17:16.369
Two or three hours from here.
As far as we can.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.164
- It's too risky.
- Risky is having him here.

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:22.584
- We don't know how to do it.
- Cowards.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.712
I'll do it with you,

00:17:26.921 --> 00:17:28.465
or I'll do it myself.

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.385
This is my land.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.849
The rotten must be removed
before it rots the rest.

00:17:40.935 --> 00:17:42.812
You have a family, Pedro.

00:17:42.812 --> 00:17:44.147
Don't you?

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.274
Do it for them.

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:49.194
Take the risk.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.739
What are you doing?

00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:53.823
Mr. Ruiz.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.909
Don't harm him.

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.536
What are you doing?
Don't harm him.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:00.580
He's too big,
he won't pass.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.332
I'm not touching him.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:05.418
Bring a rope, we tie his feet
and drag him like a pig.

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:06.711
What are you doing?

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:08.588
Taking him away.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:10.882
Take him away?
Where?

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.136
They are taking your brother.

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:17.180
Go grab a rope
or a strap to tie him.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.307
A rope? Let's lift him
using the sheets.

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.850
Grab the sheets.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.644
- They will break.
- They won't.

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:25.480
He is right, hold his feet
and let's lift him.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.648
At the same time.

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:27.774
Together.

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:29.901
One, two, three, now.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.986
Come on, together.

00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.657
Harder, harder.

00:18:35.657 --> 00:18:37.200
Wait, look.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.368
Look!

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:44.457
Nasty fucker.

00:18:44.457 --> 00:18:46.459
You are killing him.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.628
Get out, you brat,
or I'll kill you.

00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:51.589
Grab it, pull.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:53.341
Here, pull.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:55.635
Come on, come on, pull.

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:57.595
It's stuck.

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.514
It's full of shit.

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.266
Don't touch him!

00:19:01.266 --> 00:19:02.934
Let's pull together.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.978
Grab it.

00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:07.230
Be careful with the steps.

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:08.731
Careful.

00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:10.650
Pull, shit.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.944
There, at the same time.

00:19:13.444 --> 00:19:14.946
Together.

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:17.699
I'm tired, he's falling.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.451
Harder, hold it there.

00:19:20.451 --> 00:19:22.537
He's falling.

00:19:22.537 --> 00:19:24.706
Grab it, fuck you!

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:26.666
We need a blanket.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:28.626
Go fetch a blanket.

00:19:28.626 --> 00:19:30.378
Hurry up, asshole.

00:19:32.505 --> 00:19:34.465
One, two, three.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.923
Shall we throw him
here or farther?

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:16.799
How far are we?

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.509
Three hundred kilometers.

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:21.512
Let's go farther,

00:20:21.804 --> 00:20:23.389
a hundred more maybe.

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.808
Let's check him
and drive another hundred.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.230
What a smell, damn it.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.441
- Did you touch him?
- No, no.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.402
We have to burn the clothes.

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:42.116
We did alright.

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:46.454
You did well.

00:20:47.705 --> 00:20:49.457
This was the right thing to do.

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:51.292
Careful. Careful!

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:52.710
Damn.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.713
Did you hit him?
- No, I didn't

00:20:55.713 --> 00:20:57.548
where did the brat come from?

00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:59.467
The asshole
was going to school.

00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:01.886
Asshole!

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.889
Motherfucker,
just what we needed.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.849
So dangerous.

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:08.559
God damn it!

00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:26.035
Shall we drop him here?

00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:27.412
Yes.

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:28.913
And if he drowns?

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:30.164
It's kind of dry.

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:34.002
Damn it!

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:35.420
What happened?

00:21:38.548 --> 00:21:39.507
Did he jump?

00:21:39.507 --> 00:21:40.883
He can't move.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:44.303
No, it happened
when we swerved,

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:45.930
when he almost hit the kid.

00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:48.516
I asked you
to watch him, Jimmy.

00:21:48.516 --> 00:21:49.434
I didn't see it.

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:50.935
How did you not see that?

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.353
I didn't.

00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:54.731
I saw that we almost
killed a kid.

00:21:58.026 --> 00:21:59.694
How long since the kid?

00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:01.738
Twenty minutes.

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:03.614
- Sure?
- More or less.

00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:06.576
It's back there.

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:08.202
Shall we load him again?

00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:11.539
It's over.

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.125
It is far enough.

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:16.544
It's not our fucking problem.

00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:26.692
Armando.

00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:28.986
Armando.

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.280
Armando.

00:25:34.742 --> 00:25:35.993
That goat.

00:25:44.794 --> 00:25:45.753
You.

00:25:51.342 --> 00:25:52.635
No.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:54.178
No.

00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:26.085
Leave, motherfucker.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.837
Armando.

00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:30.047
Don't do it, wait.

00:26:33.801 --> 00:26:37.430
don't shoot the beast
with a firearm.

00:26:37.972 --> 00:26:40.474
You'll condemn us, love.

00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:44.312
We will be parents,
don't do it, please.

00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:46.397
Get out!

00:26:54.363 --> 00:26:56.741
Leave, fucker.

00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:58.451
Leave.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.967
I went to Ruiz's.

00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:40.177
He was dead.

00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:42.179
And his wife, too.

00:28:42.179 --> 00:28:44.056
My mother disappeared.

00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:46.308
What do you mean?
Where is she?

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:48.894
Something happened,

00:28:48.894 --> 00:28:51.355
you did the wrong thing
by taking Uriel away.

00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:53.315
Did you see Ruiz dead?

00:28:56.861 --> 00:28:59.864
Let me stay here,
I don't want to go back alone.

00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:02.491
You can't stay, leave.

00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:04.535
Please, I'm freezing to death.

00:29:04.535 --> 00:29:06.537
Please, Mr. Yazurlo.

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:11.000
Stay in the saddle room,

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:13.335
you'll find something
to stay warm.

00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:16.046
I don't want him to stay.

00:29:16.422 --> 00:29:18.048
You leave at dawn.

00:29:19.133 --> 00:29:21.010
He is armed,
you know that?

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:22.219
Are you armed?

00:29:22.219 --> 00:29:24.513
Yes, Sir,
I have a .38.

00:29:24.513 --> 00:29:26.182
Give it to him.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.896
You leave as soon
as the sun comes out.

00:29:32.313 --> 00:29:34.023
You never come back.

00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:36.233
Yes, Sir.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.076
I must tell you something.

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:48.913
Don't use electric lights.

00:29:50.915 --> 00:29:52.917
Its shadows call in the evil.

00:29:56.253 --> 00:29:57.922
Why did you let him stay?

00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:00.966
- He is scared, Jimmy.
- Don't say.

00:30:02.426 --> 00:30:03.594
Do you believe him?

00:30:04.094 --> 00:30:05.471
His mother won't abandon him.

00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:07.389
Why would she?

00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:09.391
He is lying.

00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:19.944
Five.

00:30:22.446 --> 00:30:24.490
We won't take anything
from the house.

00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:28.160
Valuables?

00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:30.454
No.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.250
Nothing that was here,

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.501
in this place.

00:30:37.503 --> 00:30:39.004
No clothes,

00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:41.590
no memories.

00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:46.470
We go to town,

00:30:48.222 --> 00:30:49.515
I pick up my kids,

00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:52.268
and we get out of here.

00:31:30.723 --> 00:31:32.057
Open up.

00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:34.685
It's me, Pedro,
we have to talk.

00:31:37.396 --> 00:31:39.023
What's going on, Pedro?

00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:41.275
We have to talk,
let me in.

00:31:44.028 --> 00:31:46.947
Does Sabrina know?
She hasn't said anything.

00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:48.407
I need to talk,
let me in.

00:31:48.407 --> 00:31:49.450
Wait.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.618
You can't enter.

00:31:50.618 --> 00:31:52.202
Wait what?

00:31:52.202 --> 00:31:54.079
Come on, let me into my house.

00:31:54.079 --> 00:31:55.539
What are you doing?

00:31:56.332 --> 00:31:58.792
Wake up Sabrina
and the kids, too.

00:31:59.043 --> 00:32:01.253
Bring two changes of clothes,
for me and my brother,

00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:02.588
I'll explain.

00:32:06.592 --> 00:32:09.219
What are you doing?
What the fuck?

00:32:10.763 --> 00:32:12.056
Listen,

00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:14.308
if you are in trouble
don't involve my family.

00:32:14.308 --> 00:32:17.353
Bring the clothes,
it's for everyone's sake.

00:32:17.353 --> 00:32:19.063
Bring them, hurry.

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:25.819
What the fuck?

00:32:33.077 --> 00:32:35.037
Sabrina, we need to talk.

00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:36.330
Is he drunk?

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.790
I don't know,
you can see for yourself.

00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:41.418
Why are you doing naked?

00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:43.712
Leave immediately.

00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:45.172
We need to talk.

00:32:45.172 --> 00:32:46.757
Why are you in my house?

00:32:46.757 --> 00:32:48.092
Leave.

00:32:48.092 --> 00:32:49.551
What's this?

00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:51.762
We need to talk,
things are happening.

00:32:51.762 --> 00:32:53.472
You are insane.

00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:54.848
There will be a disaster.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.601
You can't be here,
leave immediately.

00:32:57.601 --> 00:32:58.769
Do you hear me?

00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:00.020
Leave!

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.397
I need clothes.

00:33:09.655 --> 00:33:10.739
Fuck.

00:33:11.115 --> 00:33:12.199
Alcohol?

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:14.410
Give me that.

00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:18.080
- Don't look at me like that.
- You are insane.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.498
I'll explain.

00:33:27.172 --> 00:33:28.215
Let's go inside.

00:33:28.215 --> 00:33:29.550
No, you are not coming in.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:32.344
You're violating the restraining
order, are you aware of that?

00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:33.345
What's this?

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:35.514
You woke up Jair.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:36.807
What's this madness.

00:33:36.807 --> 00:33:39.393
Leonardo, let's go inside
and I'll explain.

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:42.146
Dad.

00:33:42.688 --> 00:33:43.731
Coquito.

00:33:44.398 --> 00:33:46.483
Santino,
go inside, it's cold.

00:33:46.483 --> 00:33:48.152
Yes, let's go inside.

00:33:50.154 --> 00:33:53.407
Do something,
take him away.

00:33:53.741 --> 00:33:56.744
Coquito, prepare a bag
with clothes, toys,

00:33:56.744 --> 00:33:59.371
and something warm,
we'll hit the road.

00:33:59.371 --> 00:34:01.582
What? Santino
isn't going anywhere.

00:34:01.582 --> 00:34:03.542
You are the one leaving.

00:34:03.542 --> 00:34:05.836
We all will leave.

00:34:07.421 --> 00:34:09.423
There's a rotten
in the town.

00:34:11.258 --> 00:34:12.926
A possessed one, Sabrina.

00:34:13.343 --> 00:34:14.720
I think it is free.

00:34:15.888 --> 00:34:18.932
This town will turn
into hell quickly.

00:34:19.433 --> 00:34:20.768
Shall I call the lawyer?

00:34:20.768 --> 00:34:23.228
Call the police,
take him away.

00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:24.605
He's scaring the kids.

00:34:28.233 --> 00:34:30.569
Dad, can Roger come with us?

00:34:30.819 --> 00:34:32.780
Yes, go prepare a bag,
hurry up.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.198
Make him leave, please.

00:34:34.198 --> 00:34:35.699
I'm hitting the road.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:37.701
He's scaring the kids.

00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:39.703
Dad, can Vicky come?

00:34:39.703 --> 00:34:42.122
Yes, we will all go,
go wake up your brother.

00:34:42.122 --> 00:34:44.583
Vicky isn't going anywhere,
Santino neither,

00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:46.502
you are leaving.

00:34:46.502 --> 00:34:47.920
I'll call the police.

00:34:48.212 --> 00:34:49.546
I made the decision,
I'm sorry.

00:34:52.382 --> 00:34:53.675
Santino,

00:34:53.675 --> 00:34:56.303
wake up your brother,
we are leaving now.

00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:58.388
What can't you understand?

00:34:58.388 --> 00:35:00.891
I make the decisions here.

00:35:00.891 --> 00:35:02.810
They aren't going anywhere.

00:35:03.393 --> 00:35:05.270
Have you heard me?

00:35:06.522 --> 00:35:08.357
You are scaring my family.

00:35:08.357 --> 00:35:11.527
A fucking rotten
in the town.

00:35:11.902 --> 00:35:14.404
Fuck you two.

00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:18.200
I saw him,
I was with him.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.410
We have to leave,
all of us.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:22.788
- Where are the car keys?
- What keys, you idiot!

00:35:22.788 --> 00:35:24.373
I don't want to argue.

00:35:24.373 --> 00:35:26.333
Stop, where are they?

00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:27.668
You are lying.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.837
You are just lying.

00:35:29.837 --> 00:35:31.547
Why are you screwing me?

00:35:31.547 --> 00:35:33.340
Can't you see me happy?

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.592
You come here
to make me feel bad,

00:35:35.592 --> 00:35:37.761
scaring the kids.

00:35:38.011 --> 00:35:39.638
Fucking crazy.

00:35:39.638 --> 00:35:43.225
You disappeared for four years,
not a single dollar,

00:35:43.225 --> 00:35:44.852
and now you come back.

00:35:44.852 --> 00:35:48.605
I let you see the kids
like a fool, and what for?

00:35:48.605 --> 00:35:50.774
You come and screw with my life.

00:35:50.774 --> 00:35:52.526
Crazy fool.

00:35:52.526 --> 00:35:54.653
What have I done
to deserve this?

00:35:54.653 --> 00:35:55.904
Leave.

00:35:55.904 --> 00:35:58.198
Start a new life, loser.

00:35:58.198 --> 00:35:59.867
I don't want you here.

00:35:59.867 --> 00:36:01.493
Stop yelling.

00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:02.953
Stop yelling!

00:36:02.953 --> 00:36:04.746
Leave, you hear?

00:36:04.746 --> 00:36:08.750
There's a restraining order,
come to your senses.

00:36:09.459 --> 00:36:11.670
What can I do
to make you understand?

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.839
You must understand,

00:36:13.839 --> 00:36:15.966
I'm telling you
there's a rotten,

00:36:15.966 --> 00:36:17.676
how can't you understand?

00:36:17.676 --> 00:36:19.803
You are insane.

00:36:19.803 --> 00:36:21.722
Are you conscious
of your words?

00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:29.521
Mom! Dad! Leo!

00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:32.566
I saw him myself.
How must I tell you?

00:36:32.566 --> 00:36:33.775
What's up?

00:36:33.775 --> 00:36:36.778
Roger bit Vicky,
it's hurting her.

00:36:42.701 --> 00:36:43.660
No!

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.829
No! Vicky!

00:36:46.413 --> 00:36:49.333
Get him! Get him!

00:36:50.751 --> 00:36:51.835
No!

00:36:52.753 --> 00:36:54.630
No, no.

00:36:55.047 --> 00:36:56.632
Vicky!

00:36:56.632 --> 00:36:57.966
Roger!

00:37:01.929 --> 00:37:03.013
Vicky!

00:37:04.848 --> 00:37:06.058
Get him!

00:37:08.518 --> 00:37:09.436
Leo!

00:37:11.355 --> 00:37:12.397
Leo!

00:37:22.366 --> 00:37:25.744
My daughter, where is she?
Help me.

00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:27.788
Help me, where is she.

00:37:27.788 --> 00:37:29.539
Where is she?

00:37:29.539 --> 00:37:32.626
Pedro, what happened?
Where is she?

00:37:32.626 --> 00:37:34.419
Where is my daughter?

00:37:34.419 --> 00:37:35.963
Santino, son.

00:37:37.798 --> 00:37:41.843
Santino, we'll leave,
stay here, yes?

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:47.516
Jair, son, it's dad.

00:37:48.058 --> 00:37:50.477
Son, son, look at me.

00:37:50.477 --> 00:37:52.062
It's dad, it's dad.

00:37:52.062 --> 00:37:53.814
Listen.

00:37:54.564 --> 00:37:57.067
No, don't bite yourself,
calm down.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.572
Jair, son.

00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:03.949
Son, look at me.

00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:06.910
Look at me, look at me.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.161
It's dad.

00:38:08.578 --> 00:38:09.871
Jair.

00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:11.331
Jair.

00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:14.835
Don't bite yourself,
don't do it.

00:38:15.168 --> 00:38:18.797
Jair, it's dad, I'm here.

00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:20.132
It's dad.

00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:23.468
Calm down, Jair.

00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:25.178
Calm down.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:38.025
Calm down, Jair,
calm down.

00:38:38.025 --> 00:38:39.109
Santi!

00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:40.736
We are leaving,

00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:41.945
hurry up, son.

00:38:41.945 --> 00:38:43.447
Where is she?

00:38:43.447 --> 00:38:44.865
Call the police.

00:38:44.865 --> 00:38:46.408
Where's the girl?

00:38:46.408 --> 00:38:48.035
Call the police.

00:38:48.035 --> 00:38:49.161
Calm down.

00:38:56.001 --> 00:38:57.669
Leo, don't use guns.

00:38:57.669 --> 00:39:00.505
Help me
find my daughter, fucker.

00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:02.090
Don't use gun powder, Leo.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.843
It's your children's sister, asshole.

00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:06.595
Help me find her.

00:39:06.595 --> 00:39:08.388
You won't find a dog,

00:39:08.388 --> 00:39:09.931
you'll find a demon.

00:39:09.931 --> 00:39:11.558
Leo.

00:39:17.647 --> 00:39:19.816
Leo, drop the gun.

00:39:20.776 --> 00:39:22.569
Don't use the gun.

00:39:23.028 --> 00:39:24.237
Leo.

00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:26.073
Damn it.

00:39:37.042 --> 00:39:39.628
Yazurlo, what's going on now?

00:39:39.628 --> 00:39:40.712
A dog.

00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:43.090
It attacked my ex's daughter.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.591
A big, brown dog.

00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:46.134
You called for a dog?

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.637
It took her, Gutierrez.

00:39:48.637 --> 00:39:49.596
It took her.

00:39:49.596 --> 00:39:50.680
Call base.

00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:54.184
What happens, Yazurlo?
What's up?

00:39:55.185 --> 00:39:56.812
Another mistake?

00:39:56.812 --> 00:39:58.021
I'm talking to you.

00:39:58.021 --> 00:39:59.606
You heard me.

00:39:59.606 --> 00:40:00.941
You can't be here.

00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:04.194
You know you can't
get close to your wife.

00:40:04.986 --> 00:40:07.197
I'm talking to you,
what have you done?

00:40:07.572 --> 00:40:10.242
Don't shoot the dog,
don't do it.

00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:45.569
You are ok, love.

00:40:46.111 --> 00:40:48.572
Thanks, where is Leo?

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:51.116
Tell him she is ok.

00:40:51.116 --> 00:40:52.742
Tell him.

00:40:53.743 --> 00:40:54.953
You are ok, love.

00:40:54.953 --> 00:40:58.248
Vicky is back,
she is back.

00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:01.001
Love, look at me.

00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:02.544
Does it hurt?

00:41:03.128 --> 00:41:04.337
Where is Leo?

00:41:04.796 --> 00:41:06.923
Tell Leo Vicky is fine, please.

00:41:07.841 --> 00:41:09.050
Are you ok?

00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:10.635
Look at me.

00:41:10.635 --> 00:41:11.678
Does it hurt?

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:17.184
Go tell Leo, please.

00:41:17.184 --> 00:41:19.978
Vicky is fine, tell him.

00:41:23.064 --> 00:41:24.691
The car keys.

00:41:26.151 --> 00:41:27.736
Where are they?

00:41:28.904 --> 00:41:31.740
Son, Jair, it's me,
it's dad.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.827
Listen, where are the keys
of mom's car?

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.871
Do you know?

00:41:37.871 --> 00:41:40.999
- Go fetch Jair's bag.
- He doesn't have one.

00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:42.918
- What then?
- A drawing.

00:41:42.918 --> 00:41:44.711
Bring it, where is it?

00:41:44.711 --> 00:41:46.880
- Where is it?
- He is holding it.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.256
Do you want ice-cream?

00:41:48.256 --> 00:41:49.925
Let's go have ice-cream.

00:41:49.925 --> 00:41:52.761
Apple ice-cream?
Let's have one.

00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:54.971
I can't find
the car keys.

00:41:54.971 --> 00:41:55.972
I can't.

00:41:55.972 --> 00:41:57.140
I'll go.

00:41:57.807 --> 00:42:00.936
I'll go, Santi,
I'll get the car.

00:42:00.936 --> 00:42:04.814
When I find the keys
of the grey car in the garage...

00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:19.412
Dad will kill you.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:22.290
What are you saying?

00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:24.084
Dad

00:42:24.084 --> 00:42:26.169
will come home

00:42:27.003 --> 00:42:28.380
in the car

00:42:28.922 --> 00:42:30.048
and pum!

00:42:35.053 --> 00:42:36.304
Love.

00:43:01.037 --> 00:43:02.789
Dad, what happened?

00:43:02.789 --> 00:43:05.333
Dad, what was that noise?

00:43:31.318 --> 00:43:32.319
Leo, Leo.

00:43:32.319 --> 00:43:33.695
Are you ok?

00:43:33.695 --> 00:43:34.446
Leo.

00:43:34.904 --> 00:43:37.240
Call the ambulance,
he is hurt.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:39.242
It's ok, easy.

00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:08.271
What's this surprise?

00:44:10.857 --> 00:44:14.944
I can't believe it,
they gave you the kids.

00:44:14.944 --> 00:44:16.321
What happened?

00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:18.031
What a nice surprise.

00:44:18.031 --> 00:44:19.282
I don't know...

00:44:19.532 --> 00:44:21.493
Sabrina?

00:44:21.785 --> 00:44:23.953
I Don't know

00:44:25.538 --> 00:44:27.290
Pedro, so nice.

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:30.460
Don't they have school?

00:44:30.835 --> 00:44:32.712
Isn't this Sabrina's car?

00:44:32.712 --> 00:44:34.464
What have you agreed with her?

00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:37.258
Have you talked with Jimmy?

00:44:37.258 --> 00:44:39.094
No, I didn't tell her.

00:44:39.094 --> 00:44:40.345
What happened?

00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:41.554
Did someone die?

00:44:42.472 --> 00:44:44.265
Nobody died,
don't?

00:44:44.265 --> 00:44:46.935
We aren't going to a wake.

00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:53.942
We are too far away
for that to happen.

00:44:53.942 --> 00:44:56.820
That things happen
in the cities.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.365
You saw anything
you didn't understand,

00:45:00.365 --> 00:45:02.200
got scared

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.285
and manipulated.

00:45:04.828 --> 00:45:06.413
It's happening, mom.

00:45:07.122 --> 00:45:09.416
Grandma,
what's a possessed one?

00:45:09.416 --> 00:45:12.752
I see you are sure,
but you may be wrong.

00:45:12.752 --> 00:45:14.087
We are sure.

00:45:15.004 --> 00:45:17.090
- Grandma.
- Stop, Santino.

00:45:17.465 --> 00:45:18.967
Are you sure, too?

00:45:20.218 --> 00:45:21.845
Yes, Jimmy too.

00:45:22.595 --> 00:45:25.181
Possessed, possessed.

00:45:25.432 --> 00:45:28.309
- Grandma.
- Stop, Santino.

00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:30.562
What did you agree
with Sabrina?

00:45:31.521 --> 00:45:33.022
What did she say?

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.526
We are leaving town.

00:45:39.112 --> 00:45:41.364
Sabrina knows, doesn't she?

00:45:45.201 --> 00:45:47.203
Have you ever
witnessed this?

00:45:47.203 --> 00:45:48.163
What?

00:45:48.163 --> 00:45:50.582
Do you know someone
who saw a possessed one?

00:45:51.249 --> 00:45:53.001
No, never.

00:45:53.877 --> 00:45:56.504
I don't,
except from you two.

00:45:57.172 --> 00:46:00.008
You are making a fuss.

00:46:01.217 --> 00:46:04.220
Grandma,
what's a possessed one?

00:46:05.472 --> 00:46:08.016
Something really, really bad.

00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:11.269
It goes into a person

00:46:11.269 --> 00:46:13.980
and uses it's body
to be born.

00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:16.149
Like a disease?

00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:19.360
There's a song,
do you know it?

00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:20.862
No.

00:46:21.321 --> 00:46:23.323
It's famous.

00:46:23.907 --> 00:46:26.451
They get into your body,

00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:28.995
they infect your mind,

00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:32.332
they take the most valuable
thing in your life,

00:46:32.332 --> 00:46:34.417
your body is no longer
your body.

00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:36.252
That's really bad.

00:46:36.252 --> 00:46:37.295
Well,

00:46:38.171 --> 00:46:41.174
it's not that bad
if you take precautions.

00:46:41.174 --> 00:46:45.386
Look, there are
seven rules to follow

00:46:45.386 --> 00:46:48.431
and remember
when there's a possessed one.

00:46:48.932 --> 00:46:50.141
For what?

00:46:50.141 --> 00:46:52.519
So they don't get
into your head

00:46:52.519 --> 00:46:54.354
and make you do stuff

00:46:54.354 --> 00:46:56.022
you don't want to do.

00:46:57.106 --> 00:46:59.192
Don't use electric lights.

00:46:59.192 --> 00:47:01.402
Don't stay close to animals.

00:47:02.111 --> 00:47:06.574
Don't have to take anything
that was close to them.

00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:08.660
Don't hurt them.

00:47:09.244 --> 00:47:11.162
And a very important rule,

00:47:11.162 --> 00:47:14.415
never, ever name the evil
by its name.

00:47:14.415 --> 00:47:16.417
Evil has a name?

00:47:16.417 --> 00:47:18.211
Of course.

00:47:18.962 --> 00:47:19.629
Look...

00:47:20.088 --> 00:47:21.673
- Lucifer...
- Mom.

00:47:22.006 --> 00:47:23.633
- Azrael...
- Mom.

00:47:23.633 --> 00:47:25.134
Beelzebub.

00:47:25.134 --> 00:47:27.053
You are naming them.

00:47:27.345 --> 00:47:29.305
Yes, you are right.

00:47:31.474 --> 00:47:34.060
There's a very important rule, too.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.646
Don't shoot them
with fire arms.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:38.481
Stop, mom. Stop.

00:47:38.481 --> 00:47:39.691
What else.

00:47:40.483 --> 00:47:41.985
That's it.

00:47:43.111 --> 00:47:44.529
There's one missing.

00:47:45.154 --> 00:47:48.032
- Haven't I told the seven?
- No.

00:47:48.283 --> 00:47:50.118
That should be a rule.

00:47:50.994 --> 00:47:52.328
Don't forget the rules.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.001
Azrael.

00:48:00.336 --> 00:48:02.171
A simple apple ice-cream.

00:48:02.672 --> 00:48:04.132
They don't have apple.

00:48:04.132 --> 00:48:06.217
This is not enough, though.
Do you have money?

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:07.635
It's all I had with me.

00:48:07.635 --> 00:48:08.636
Check.

00:48:08.636 --> 00:48:11.097
I'm telling you,
I don't have.

00:48:11.097 --> 00:48:13.433
You didn't ask me to.

00:48:13.433 --> 00:48:15.560
I thought
you were paying.

00:48:16.019 --> 00:48:17.103
Dad.

00:48:17.687 --> 00:48:19.314
I want to go home.

00:48:19.314 --> 00:48:21.357
We need to get more money.

00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:22.567
Dad.

00:48:28.531 --> 00:48:30.116
How are we going to eat?

00:48:30.116 --> 00:48:31.409
I want to go home.

00:48:32.118 --> 00:48:33.328
What about Jair?

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.791
Where is a fucking
apple ice-cream...

00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:43.254
Jair won't stop.

00:48:44.047 --> 00:48:48.301
Well, we can go back to town,
we buy the ice-cream.

00:48:48.301 --> 00:48:49.636
Mom, no.

00:48:49.636 --> 00:48:51.554
How long could it take?

00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:53.556
No, mom, we can't go back.

00:48:58.811 --> 00:49:00.271
What are you doing
with the phone.

00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:03.024
- I told you to leave everything.
- I didn't.

00:49:03.024 --> 00:49:04.609
No, it's mine.

00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:06.110
It's mine.

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.654
It's Sabrina.

00:49:09.656 --> 00:49:11.532
Talk to your mother.

00:49:12.742 --> 00:49:15.411
Dad, I want to talk to mom.

00:49:15.411 --> 00:49:16.746
It can't be her.

00:49:16.746 --> 00:49:18.373
Dad, I want to talk.

00:49:18.373 --> 00:49:20.249
Santino, it's not mom.

00:49:20.792 --> 00:49:22.377
Shall I answer?

00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:27.382
I want to talk to mom.

00:49:47.735 --> 00:49:48.653
Hello.

00:49:49.404 --> 00:49:51.322
You took my children.

00:49:51.614 --> 00:49:55.159
I want them back.

00:49:56.661 --> 00:49:57.745
The kids are alright.

00:49:57.745 --> 00:50:00.373
Jair can't be far from home.

00:50:00.373 --> 00:50:04.127
He has to take his medicine,
bring him back!

00:50:04.377 --> 00:50:06.379
Jair will decompensate!

00:50:06.379 --> 00:50:09.298
The kids are fine, Jair is fine,
they are fine with me.

00:50:09.841 --> 00:50:12.510
Realize your sons
don't love you.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.220
They can't see you.

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:16.305
They never want
to go to your house,

00:50:16.305 --> 00:50:18.391
they don't want
to live with you.

00:50:18.391 --> 00:50:19.809
Don't you get it?

00:50:20.518 --> 00:50:22.729
That's why I cheated on you.

00:50:22.729 --> 00:50:25.565
That's why I fucked everyone.

00:50:25.565 --> 00:50:26.524
Sabrina.

00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:28.276
You are no one.

00:50:28.276 --> 00:50:31.612
A little man, a little man.

00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:34.407
You gave me a broken kid.

00:50:34.407 --> 00:50:37.160
You wanted to get rid of him.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.619
You are a bastard.

00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:41.372
And a murderer.

00:50:41.831 --> 00:50:43.499
Everyone knows it.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.753
I know where you are.

00:50:46.753 --> 00:50:49.172
I'll come get my kids

00:50:49.839 --> 00:50:51.758
and get them back.

00:50:52.175 --> 00:50:54.343
You don't know
what I'm capable of.

00:50:56.429 --> 00:50:57.722
Sabrina, I saw you die.

00:50:57.722 --> 00:50:59.724
I'll get my kids,
do you hear?

00:50:59.724 --> 00:51:02.268
I'll get-

00:51:07.565 --> 00:51:08.858
Brother, what happened?

00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:11.527
What happened?

00:51:13.196 --> 00:51:14.363
Sabrina is dead.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:18.576
Her husband hit her
with the truck, he killed her.

00:51:19.619 --> 00:51:20.870
That wasn't Sabrina.

00:51:21.913 --> 00:51:23.414
What do you mean?

00:51:26.417 --> 00:51:28.419
What? What happened?

00:51:28.419 --> 00:51:30.421
She is dead, Jimmy.

00:51:31.714 --> 00:51:34.383
I saw her die,
I saw her.

00:51:35.551 --> 00:51:37.428
I'm not even sure
of what's going on.

00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:39.222
I'm going crazy.

00:51:42.767 --> 00:51:44.560
I'm a coward.

00:51:46.979 --> 00:51:49.732
I can't handle my life,
I'm a coward.

00:51:50.525 --> 00:51:52.777
I doubt this is the right thing.

00:51:53.319 --> 00:51:55.238
I took the evil to her,

00:51:55.696 --> 00:51:58.449
I almost killed them all.

00:51:59.659 --> 00:52:03.871
We should have left
as soon as we knew.

00:52:04.705 --> 00:52:08.501
I should have never
come back to this town.

00:52:09.252 --> 00:52:11.379
Easy, don't say that.

00:52:12.588 --> 00:52:14.423
I'm proud of you.

00:52:15.925 --> 00:52:16.968
Come on, brother,

00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:19.387
the kids are watching.

00:52:19.387 --> 00:52:20.805
They will get scared.

00:52:20.805 --> 00:52:21.722
Come on.

00:52:21.722 --> 00:52:23.432
You didn't see what I saw.

00:52:25.768 --> 00:52:26.853
Come on.

00:52:33.943 --> 00:52:35.903
I know someone
that may be of help.

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.365
She lives half-way to the city.

00:52:40.783 --> 00:52:42.451
What will you say?

00:52:42.952 --> 00:52:44.287
I'm not sure,

00:52:44.287 --> 00:52:46.747
but I think she lived
something similar to this.

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:49.709
She can lend us money, too.

00:52:53.754 --> 00:52:55.339
Jair won't stop.

00:52:55.882 --> 00:53:00.386
He won't until I get him
apple ice-cream I promised.

00:53:01.804 --> 00:53:03.723
Brother,
get your head together.

00:53:03.723 --> 00:53:04.932
Get up.

00:53:05.975 --> 00:53:08.060
Mom will get upset.

00:53:19.363 --> 00:53:20.865
She is Mirta.

00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:22.909
How are you, ma'am?

00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:25.369
I have no electrical power,

00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:28.289
but there's room for everyone,
stay as long as you want.

00:53:28.289 --> 00:53:30.666
No, we are going to the city.

00:53:31.042 --> 00:53:32.960
Thank you, anyway.

00:53:39.342 --> 00:53:41.969
Pedro, are you sure
we'll be better in the city?

00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:43.679
Will she give us money?

00:53:43.679 --> 00:53:44.931
Yes.

00:53:45.723 --> 00:53:47.308
Let's stop for a while.

00:53:47.308 --> 00:53:48.601
We are tired.

00:53:49.018 --> 00:53:51.646
Jair needs changing.

00:53:51.646 --> 00:53:53.731
Mirta is ok with this.

00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:55.900
It's better for her,
she is alone.

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:57.693
We can't, Jimmy.

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.488
We are going to the city,
don't change the plan.

00:54:00.488 --> 00:54:01.614
Besides,

00:54:02.073 --> 00:54:03.783
tell her that...

00:54:03.783 --> 00:54:06.619
we'll give her the money back
because we are good people.

00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:11.040
That's an issue,

00:54:11.707 --> 00:54:13.542
she has the money
in the bank.

00:54:13.542 --> 00:54:15.461
It's there until Monday.

00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:18.047
We can meet her there.

00:54:18.047 --> 00:54:20.549
Jair needs changing.

00:54:25.554 --> 00:54:27.390
Dad, Jair pooped.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:28.933
He pooped.

00:54:33.396 --> 00:54:35.064
The kid looks rotten.

00:54:37.066 --> 00:54:38.484
He is autistic.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.071
Yes, you told me.

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:48.911
You saw a real possessed one, right?

00:54:52.581 --> 00:54:53.916
Why do you ask?

00:54:54.417 --> 00:54:56.919
You told me.
When you lived in the city.

00:54:57.837 --> 00:54:59.755
You were close to one.

00:54:59.755 --> 00:55:00.840
Did I?

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:02.049
Long ago.

00:55:03.426 --> 00:55:05.594
That you got used
to living among them.

00:55:06.846 --> 00:55:09.098
I don't know
why I said that.

00:55:09.932 --> 00:55:11.767
I'm good
at getting secrets out.

00:55:13.436 --> 00:55:14.895
What did you come here for?

00:55:18.149 --> 00:55:20.067
I think we saw
a possessed one for real.

00:55:21.152 --> 00:55:22.445
Where?

00:55:23.487 --> 00:55:24.572
In town?

00:55:27.533 --> 00:55:28.659
You got scared.

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:33.956
It seems so.

00:55:35.124 --> 00:55:38.627
If you saw a possessed one,
you wouldn't say "I think".

00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:41.756
You wouldn't doubt a bit.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.675
I'm not sure what we saw.

00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:47.720
Babies who don't cry?

00:55:49.055 --> 00:55:50.806
Shadows that move
on their own?

00:55:50.806 --> 00:55:53.142
Animals doing stuff
they'll never do?

00:55:53.142 --> 00:55:55.061
I don't know
what we saw.

00:55:57.813 --> 00:56:00.775
Maybe it was
my brother's imagination.

00:56:00.775 --> 00:56:02.234
But maybe not.

00:56:02.735 --> 00:56:05.696
Maybe it's real
and I can't understand.

00:56:06.489 --> 00:56:10.159
Is that the brother who plugged
the heater outtake?

00:56:12.036 --> 00:56:15.164
That was a lie his wife told
to keep the children.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.126
He suffered a lot.

00:56:21.629 --> 00:56:24.590
People from town are bored
and like talking shit,

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:27.093
after all, it's free.

00:56:31.806 --> 00:56:33.516
It's ok, darling.

00:56:34.725 --> 00:56:36.727
Well, well.

00:56:37.269 --> 00:56:38.604
Yes?

00:56:38.604 --> 00:56:42.108
Close your little eyes,

00:56:43.859 --> 00:56:45.736
don't open them...

00:56:50.533 --> 00:56:51.742
He won't sleep.

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.537
Are you staying up
another night?

00:56:55.037 --> 00:56:58.499
I'd rather mom tucks Santino in
and I'll look after Jair.

00:56:59.208 --> 00:57:00.835
He won't leave the car.

00:57:02.837 --> 00:57:04.171
Let's take turns.

00:57:04.547 --> 00:57:05.673
No.

00:57:08.008 --> 00:57:09.760
So, this is the famous Mirta.

00:57:11.262 --> 00:57:12.179
Mirta.

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:15.975
Why are you smiling?

00:57:16.892 --> 00:57:18.144
Why are you smiling?

00:57:18.144 --> 00:57:19.270
I'm not.

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:23.732
It was long ago.

00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:26.277
I was younger.

00:57:27.736 --> 00:57:28.779
She was, too.

00:57:29.113 --> 00:57:30.197
Of course.

00:57:31.073 --> 00:57:32.992
You were always a lovebird.

00:57:33.576 --> 00:57:35.244
Always a lovebird.

00:57:36.078 --> 00:57:38.539
Every year you cried
like a pig.

00:57:39.582 --> 00:57:41.584
You said
you missed the teachers.

00:57:46.839 --> 00:57:48.174
I love you, brother.

00:58:01.729 --> 00:58:04.523
I'm here, son, I'm here.

00:58:04.523 --> 00:58:07.026
It's dad.

00:58:07.776 --> 00:58:08.944
I'll take care of you.

00:58:11.071 --> 00:58:12.781
Nothing will happen to you.

00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.881
Sabrina?

00:59:53.882 --> 00:59:55.259
Is that you?

00:59:58.804 --> 01:00:01.056
I'm happy you are here.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:03.475
I'm a bit drugged.

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:07.479
I took my sleeping pills.

01:00:09.148 --> 01:00:11.442
I came for my children.

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:14.987
Because they need me.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:18.741
I'm taking my children

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:22.286
to a place where no one
can harm them.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.915
Mom, I'm cold.

01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:31.253
Pedro.

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:33.213
Pedro.

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.841
Something's going on.

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.808
I can't say what I saw,

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:47.311
but it wasn't her,
I thought it was Sabrina,

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.771
but I don't know.

01:00:48.771 --> 01:00:49.730
Calm down.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:50.898
I can't say,

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:53.108
but there's someone
with Santino.

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:55.277
I'm not sure.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.696
Calm down, mom.

01:00:57.696 --> 01:00:59.365
I came down to tell you,

01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:01.700
because I'm afraid.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:02.993
I'm afraid.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.328
I didn't know what to do.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:05.454
Calm down.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.956
- I was too scared.
- Calm down.

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.459
- I didn't know what to do.
- Easy.

01:01:21.804 --> 01:01:23.430
I came for my children.

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:26.850
Because they need me.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:29.311
I'm taking my children

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.439
to a place where no one
can harm them.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.991
Dad.

01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:47.121
No, no!

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:48.997
Son.

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.252
She jumped, that fucker.

01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:54.962
She jumped with Santino.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:56.422
She took him.

01:01:56.422 --> 01:01:57.506
Fucker.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:01:59.842
Where is he?

01:02:00.092 --> 01:02:00.926
Where?

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:02.344
He has to be here.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.388
Look over there.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:06.056
Son!

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.058
Son!

01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:10.060
Jair.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.020
Jair.

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:14.148
Jair.

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:16.191
Son.

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:18.193
Jair, son.

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:20.279
Jair, son.

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:23.407
Son.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:25.075
It's dad.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.161
Son, son.

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:29.621
Son, open, open.

01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:31.915
Jair.

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:40.340
Jair, son, are you ok?

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.093
Are you ok?
It's dad.

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:45.387
Jair is fine.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.055
What's this blood?

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:49.099
- Where did it come from?
- I don't know.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.309
Go get some flashlights.

01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:52.060
We need flashlights.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:52.978
Jaime.

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:54.104
Santino.

01:02:54.563 --> 01:02:55.606
Son.

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:58.525
Santino.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:00.444
Son.

01:03:02.321 --> 01:03:03.614
Santino.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.452
Are there more flashlights?

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.537
Something to light.

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:12.831
Jaime, there's a demon.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.583
It took my nephew.

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:16.251
It's inside the kid.

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:17.336
No, he is like that.

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:18.462
No, Jaime.

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:20.672
He is like that.

01:03:20.923 --> 01:03:23.467
Shut up, Jaime,
listen to me.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:28.263
Come over here
and look at the kid.

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:32.559
Look at his feet and hands.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.979
A demon got into his head
and is trapped.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:39.024
I saw this in autistic people.

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:42.486
They invade their bodies but
can't figure out their minds.

01:03:42.945 --> 01:03:46.198
They can stay lost
in that limbo for a long time

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:48.575
without untying the knot,
and then they possess them.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:52.162
The kid can be possessed,
do you get it?

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:55.874
Jimmy, I need you,
the flashlight.

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:58.377
Go get your brother,
we need to get inside.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.587
I can't leave him alone.

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.965
It took Santino,
it must be near.

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:05.300
It is near,
it is everywhere.

01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:06.969
Listen to me,

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:08.720
both of you.

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:13.642
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:25.654
The song says so.

01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:28.407
If you are afraid
of falling into a hole,

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:30.659
It will put a hole
under you.

01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:36.665
There's people like us,
whose thoughts It can't control.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.085
But It can manipulate us,

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:41.461
because in here,

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.922
I'm sure that it is here,

01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:45.424
It was, some time,

01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:48.218
It was
and it got information.

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:52.347
It's the seventh rule,
don't be afraid of dying.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.267
She wouldn't be here

01:04:55.267 --> 01:04:59.187
if you weren't afraid
she would take the kids.

01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:02.024
You can't go get your kid.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:05.027
You must understand why.

01:05:05.444 --> 01:05:07.779
Your fear of losing him
helps the demon.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:11.658
Evil knows more about your fears
than you do.

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:14.536
Then I'll go,
I'll get Santino.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:16.038
I promise I'll find him.

01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:17.289
I'll go, too,

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.625
she must be near town.

01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:23.211
No, we have to find
the rotten.

01:05:24.713 --> 01:05:27.507
Kill the man to stop
the beast from being born.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:30.218
The rotten is dead
or this won't be happening.

01:05:30.218 --> 01:05:31.511
No, no.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:34.222
This is what we call
"the birth process".

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:36.767
For now, It just
freed its essence.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.144
It may not
be physically born,

01:05:39.144 --> 01:05:41.647
so we have to kill it, to
abort it as soon as possible.

01:05:41.647 --> 01:05:43.607
We know where he is.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:45.150
We do know.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.818
It's near General Piran.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:49.446
That's far from town.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.157
How are you so sure?

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:53.617
We...

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.578
moved the man
and took him there.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:01.333
You moved a rotten?

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.754
Knowing he was possessed?

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.131
You idiots.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:14.805
Jaime.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.517
The town lights.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.852
They are off.

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:24.398
They cut the power,
they activated the protocol.

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:27.776
Who knows
what's going on.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.530
It's dangerous
to go back.

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:34.866
Don't use lights.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:38.453
Be careful.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.314
My husband was a shepherd,

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.275
we had a church.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:10.819
We were frauds.

01:07:13.447 --> 01:07:14.740
The first possessed one
in Buenos Aires

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:16.908
appeared in our church.

01:07:17.284 --> 01:07:22.289
At first, I thought
it was an actor we hired,

01:07:22.581 --> 01:07:25.500
until he puked over all of us.

01:07:26.168 --> 01:07:27.711
He puked up the rest
of the family

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:30.172
he had eaten the previous night.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:33.383
God is dead,

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:36.553
and the times of churches
ended quickly.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.557
Then the cobras appeared,

01:07:41.183 --> 01:07:44.686
those monks who taught us
there was a way

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.855
of killing them before
they were born.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:51.651
That's what we did
for twelve years.

01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:57.741
We took responsibility for
the damage we did to faith.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.511
Ambushes started
growing in number.

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:20.889
It's no surprise
they killed the cleaner.

01:08:21.556 --> 01:08:24.351
That's why everything turned...

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:26.853
secretive.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:29.397
We had to be too careful.

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.651
We were old for this.

01:08:33.235 --> 01:08:34.986
You lose your reflexes.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.364
One night, my husband...

01:08:39.241 --> 01:08:40.992
didn't come back
from a cleaning.

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.412
Then I left town.

01:08:45.914 --> 01:08:47.249
From evil,

01:08:48.333 --> 01:08:50.377
you only escape
leaving everything behind

01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:52.462
and running away

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:55.340
to a place
even you don't know existed.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:57.634
That's what I did.

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.970
Such a coincidence,
you here,

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:01.763
in the middle of nowhere.

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:07.310
What if evil finally found me
inside Jaime's head?

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:15.360
What if It infected the town
just for me?

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.613
Why didn't It take you
instead of my son?

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.413
Because you are the one
who is afraid.

01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:12.852
We'll have to continue on foot.

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:16.815
If he moved
or was moved,

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:18.733
it will be impossible
to find him.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.402
There.

01:11:21.403 --> 01:11:22.821
He must be there.

01:11:22.821 --> 01:11:23.989
RURAL SCHOOL

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:28.076
Evil likes children,
and children like evil.

01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:09.117
Jimmy.

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:13.163
You told me you loved me.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:35.643
I'm hungry.

01:12:37.896 --> 01:12:39.481
And cold, grandma.

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:42.901
Can you prepare
something hot to drink?

01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:46.112
Tea or something.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.666
I don't want
to get sick.

01:13:12.931 --> 01:13:14.224
Turn the lights off.

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:24.943
How do you know
it's not too late?

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:28.363
Because what Evil eats first
when born

01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:30.198
is the sound of nature.

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:34.786
Birds and crickets
are still chirping.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.789
No more lights.

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:39.165
No more lights.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.584
Don't use electric stuff.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:17.031
Where is it?

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:20.159
Is it here?

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:23.454
Are you hiding it here?

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.210
Can you tell me
where it is?

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:34.382
We came to help you.

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:11.210
What happened?

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:13.421
What happened?

01:17:14.172 --> 01:17:15.340
Didn't...

01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:17.300
Didn't you smell it?

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.509
What?

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:21.054
The breath of the kids.

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:22.847
They won't help us.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:24.265
But you said
it was here.

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:25.933
Or they are hiding it.

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:27.477
Somewhere.

01:17:28.770 --> 01:17:30.480
I've never seen
such a thing.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.776
I don't know
if I can deal with this.

01:17:35.193 --> 01:17:37.945
All those kids together.

01:17:41.032 --> 01:17:43.034
is he coming here?

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:46.412
Kids protect the rotten.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.414
This is crazy.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.876
Don't scare him.

01:17:53.211 --> 01:17:54.253
Kid.

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:57.173
Are you going to school?

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.341
Listen to me.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.176
Do you know
about someone,

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:01.803
or maybe your friends do,

01:18:01.803 --> 01:18:04.806
about someone hurt,

01:18:04.806 --> 01:18:06.974
injured near here?

01:18:07.558 --> 01:18:09.060
Did you find
someone sick

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.978
or injured near here?

01:18:10.978 --> 01:18:13.147
Yesterday or the day before.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.401
I'm talking to you!
Answer me!

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:20.988
I'll go inside
and make him talk.

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:21.906
No.

01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:23.241
It's not a good idea.

01:18:23.241 --> 01:18:26.160
Is there any other idea?
Any good idea?

01:18:27.245 --> 01:18:29.789
I'll make him talk no matter
how, I don't give a damn.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:30.498
No.

01:18:30.832 --> 01:18:32.375
We can't make mistakes.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.961
Not one,
our lives are at stake.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:37.171
Let me think.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.342
We shouldn't rush now.

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:46.013
We have to keep an eye
on each other.

01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:50.601
Are you looking for Uriel?

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:52.103
Yes, yes.

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:54.397
He's at teacher Cortez's house.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.815
Where is that?

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:57.900
Don't you know?

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.193
No, I don't.

01:18:59.986 --> 01:19:01.112
Near the traffic circle.

01:19:01.112 --> 01:19:02.280
Traffic circle, yes.

01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:04.282
An entrance with trees.

01:19:04.282 --> 01:19:05.533
On the traffic circle?

01:19:07.326 --> 01:19:09.036
Can you come with us?

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:16.544
Let's go.

01:19:18.004 --> 01:19:19.380
Mirta, come on.

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:32.059
It may not be like that,

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.520
and there's someone
waiting for us.

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:35.980
A trap?

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:38.566
We have no time,
we have to find out.

01:19:38.566 --> 01:19:39.901
Let's go.

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:42.487
It's a lie.

01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:45.990
A lie, don't go
where he said.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:48.409
He is not there,
Uriel is in my house,

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:51.245
in my house,
in my house.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:54.582
My father wanted to help
and cure him.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:58.586
I live there, in the hill,
but please be careful.

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:02.048
Motherfuckers,
stop lying, fuckers.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.674
Motherfuckers.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:07.512
They took my son,
I want my son, fuckers.

01:20:07.512 --> 01:20:09.222
Fuckers.

01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:12.058
It is here, Pedro.

01:20:16.062 --> 01:20:17.522
It is here.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:31.577
If they send us somewhere else,

01:20:35.456 --> 01:20:37.250
it's because they have him here.

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:16.956
Dead...

01:21:17.415 --> 01:21:18.749
the adults.

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:23.170
I have never seen this.

01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:26.549
Did the kids do it?

01:21:28.718 --> 01:21:30.344
Those aren't kids anymore.

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:32.597
Go get my stuff.

01:21:33.306 --> 01:21:34.682
Don't run.

01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:38.060
Don't hurry.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:42.106
It's possible It is down there.

01:21:51.282 --> 01:21:53.200
I told you not to run.

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.077
Be careful.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.143
We found you, motherfucker.

01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:21.562
We found you.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:25.024
You have to leave,
he wants to kill you.

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:27.652
He wants to kill you,
don't you see it?

01:22:27.652 --> 01:22:31.197
The parents and teachers are
dead, they are there inside.

01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:32.448
Don't move.

01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:34.659
Don't even move.

01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:37.370
They covered the bodies
with lime to hide the smell,

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:39.455
so they can't be found.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.749
Please, you have to leave.

01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:44.502
They are bad,
you will die,

01:22:44.502 --> 01:22:46.253
you have to leave.

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:48.464
You will die.

01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:53.094
We have to take him out. Hurry.

01:22:53.094 --> 01:22:55.096
We have no more time.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.604
Go away, you still have time.
Go away.

01:23:14.281 --> 01:23:16.617
No, no, no.

01:23:22.123 --> 01:23:23.290
Come on, Pedro.

01:23:34.135 --> 01:23:36.512
Pedro, don't waste more time.

01:23:40.141 --> 01:23:41.392
No, please, no.

01:23:41.392 --> 01:23:42.560
One is alive.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.770
It doesn't matter,
take the rotten.

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:46.731
We have no time.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:53.821
You'll die, leave, please.

01:23:55.906 --> 01:23:58.325
You'll die, leave.

01:23:58.743 --> 01:24:02.329
Hurry,
we have to take him out now.

01:24:03.247 --> 01:24:05.332
You're gonna get infected.

01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:16.635
It's here.

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:17.762
Is it alive?

01:24:18.429 --> 01:24:19.346
I don't know.

01:24:21.849 --> 01:24:23.350
He is moving.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:25.728
Kill me.

01:24:27.855 --> 01:24:29.899
Kill me now.

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:32.276
Don't think about it.

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:34.612
The only way to kill him
is using this.

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:36.238
Take him out.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:38.908
Get this over with

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:40.659
Hurry, Pedro.

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:44.455
His nape,
I need to see his nape.

01:24:45.206 --> 01:24:46.207
I can't.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.833
I can't lift him.

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:51.295
This goes into his nape,
I need to see it.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:52.797
I can't.

01:24:53.214 --> 01:24:54.423
Come, help me.

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:55.341
No.

01:24:55.341 --> 01:24:56.592
I can't do it alone.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:57.802
Keep her away.

01:24:57.802 --> 01:24:59.386
I have to dismantle
the stage.

01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:00.805
Do it then.

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:03.432
You wanted to kill yourself,

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:05.267
with your kids,

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.394
you can do that to me.

01:25:07.394 --> 01:25:08.938
Shut up, fucker.

01:25:09.230 --> 01:25:11.148
Shut up, shut up.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.691
There's an axe
in the director's office,

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:14.902
the axe for the fires.

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:16.237
No, she is lying.

01:25:16.237 --> 01:25:17.363
In a red cabinet.

01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:18.531
She is lying.

01:25:18.531 --> 01:25:19.865
I saw it.

01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:20.991
Pedro,

01:25:21.492 --> 01:25:23.285
all of this is your fault.

01:25:24.829 --> 01:25:27.665
Don't listen,
don't let him manipulate you,

01:25:27.665 --> 01:25:29.708
take the rotten.

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.752
Do it for Santino,

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:33.796
don't let him die.

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:36.507
You can still save him.

01:25:36.507 --> 01:25:38.843
Yes, yes, bring the axe.

01:25:38.843 --> 01:25:40.594
No, Pedro.

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:41.762
Kill me.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:46.684
It's a trap,
don't leave me alone.

01:25:46.684 --> 01:25:48.519
Don't leave me alone.

01:25:51.313 --> 01:25:52.314
No.

01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:53.607
No.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.573
Fuckers.

01:26:10.749 --> 01:26:12.668
No, no, no!

01:26:58.505 --> 01:26:59.798
Pedro...

01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:36.700
There was...

01:31:37.784 --> 01:31:40.370
a voice in my head,

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:46.168
which forced me
to kill the person

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:49.046
who was going
to help Uriel.

01:31:50.297 --> 01:31:53.091
I cut his body into pieces,

01:31:53.842 --> 01:31:56.803
I fed it to the pigs.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:02.726
I also ate,
I ate from that body.

01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:04.811
And your mom?

01:32:05.646 --> 01:32:06.688
What happened to her?

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:09.650
The same that happened
to your mother.

01:32:35.133 --> 01:32:36.176
Slowly, son.

01:32:57.114 --> 01:32:58.365
Breathe.

01:32:58.991 --> 01:33:01.368
Come on.
