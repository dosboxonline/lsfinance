WEBVTT

1
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.159
Can we go now?

2
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.167
Our suspect is in the hotel,
but don't worry,

3
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:59.860
your client is in no danger.
My best man's on the job.

4
00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:05.727
Gibert to Alain.

5
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:11.027
Suspect located.
Distance roughly... 15 meters.

6
00:01:11.068 --> 00:01:13.330
- Get over here.
- I'm here, boss.

7
00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.029
Concentrate, Alain!

8
00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:17.433
See the wildcat at 11 o'clock?

9
00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:20.226
It's a maritime expression.

10
00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:23.429
In Marseille 10 years,
and still not seen the sea?

11
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.629
I have. When we patrol the port.

12
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.432
OK, I see.

13
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.732
12 o'clock is straight ahead,

14
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.225
so 11 o'clock's that way,
a bit to the left.

15
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:35.803
I get it.

16
00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:38.103
Are you sure that's a suspect?

17
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:39.796
Looks like a chambermaid.

18
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.394
A terrorist doesn't go round yelling

19
00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:44.597
with explosives
strapped to his waist.

20
00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:45.003
That's right.

21
00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.595
They wear disguise.

22
00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:51.899
What better than a chambermaid

23
00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.405
- pushing her cart along?
- Of course.

24
00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.803
Especially in a hotel.

25
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.704
The song encourages him
to commit his dastardly act.

26
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.002
Sounds like Spanish.

27
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.700
A revolutionary anthem!

28
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:10.268
Watch out!

29
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:14.967
On my signal, neutralize the Basque!

30
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.372
10/5.

31
00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:19.374
12 o'clock!

32
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.168
Good job!
Betrayed by his own song!

33
00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.175
To the cars!

34
00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.069
I'll question him later.

35
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.167
What's happening?

36
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.267
Sir, I've just neutralized
the Hispanic terrorist

37
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.572
with a cart full of

38
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.769
what look like toxic products.

39
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.071
I'm sending them to the lab.

40
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:41.372
Perfect, Gibert!

41
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:44.343
Get the client out of his room
or he'll be late.

42
00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:46.240
It's as good as done, sir.

43
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:49.241
Emilien? Coast's clear

44
00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:51.039
to deliver the package.

45
00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:53.039
Emilien! Answer me!

46
00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:54.544
I'm almost outside his door, chief!

47
00:02:55.278 --> 00:02:56.938
Honestly, jumping me on the job!

48
00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.241
I can't help it.

49
00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:03.041
You turn me on
when you're in action.

50
00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.942
Reminds me of Sean Connery.

51
00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:06.036
Don't take liberties,

52
00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.739
just because you're stronger than me.

53
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.643
Next time, you can tie me down.

54
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.238
Quiet! The whole hotel's bugged.

55
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.109
Yes, Inspector!

56
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.806
I'll handle the package.
You find Gibert.

57
00:03:22.248 --> 00:03:23.907
I love you, Emilien.

58
00:03:23.948 --> 00:03:25.811
I love you, too, but not now!

59
00:03:25.848 --> 00:03:27.508
Tonight, at home!

60
00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:34.705
Mr. Cisse!

61
00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.307
You're due on the pitch
in 20 minutes.

62
00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.714
The charity is 9 For Africa. We're
building an orphanage. That's my goal.

63
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.815
Sorry, but I'm with the police.
I'm here to...

64
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.180
- What's your name?
- Emilien.

65
00:03:51.651 --> 00:03:53.480
No, it's not for a...
It's for the...

66
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.676
This is no time to exchange cards.

67
00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:59.081
OK, where's this Gerbil-jibly...

68
00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:01.584
That'll twist foreign tongues.

69
00:04:01.618 --> 00:04:03.084
The name's Djibril Cisse.

70
00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:04.483
Don't get smart with me,

71
00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.679
or you'll be straight in the pen.

72
00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.881
Emilien, look.
Nothing like him.

73
00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.078
The nose, teeth...

74
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.779
It's him, sir. I promise you.

75
00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.479
Not too fast!
I smell a rat and I should know.

76
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.680
2 years at customs.
No illegals get past me.

77
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.652
I bust the Korean people
smugglers in '92.

78
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.743
- He's not Korean.
- Can you be sure?

79
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.548
I checked his ID.

80
00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:30.143
- Look, slant eyes.
- He's just tired.

81
00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.745
Let's go.

82
00:04:32.788 --> 00:04:33.845
The Prefect will lose patience.

83
00:04:33.888 --> 00:04:35.649
To the cars!

84
00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:43.944
I don't know why,
but you're not popular here.

85
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.653
Don't worry,
he prefers fishing to football.

86
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.951
Mumbling again, Emilien?

87
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.115
I was just saying
you're a keen angler.

88
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.917
That's a real sport.

89
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.115
Do you fly fish?

90
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.520
I never do anything on the fly.

91
00:05:01.557 --> 00:05:04.819
Quite right!

92
00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:08.915
There's no room
for amateurism in fishing.

93
00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.118
Take float fishing, for example,
for stillwater tench.

94
00:05:12.158 --> 00:05:13.920
You can lie in wait for hours
like a vulture,

95
00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:16.118
watching the float, then...

96
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.019
What is it now?

97
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.117
- Nothing broken?
- No, I'm fine.

98
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.388
Can't you ring your bell?

99
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.893
They said Mr. Cisse was asleep.
We didn't want to wake him.

100
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.393
He's in my car.
We're transferring him.

101
00:05:35.427 --> 00:05:36.893
Djibril Cisse?

102
00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:38.893
Transferred to Marseille?

103
00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:41.792
Shit, it's Cisse!

104
00:05:42.428 --> 00:05:44.189
Do something
or we'll miss the match.

105
00:05:44.228 --> 00:05:45.489
Don't worry,

106
00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:47.494
I know a guy who can help.

107
00:05:51.828 --> 00:05:53.089
The police have taxis?

108
00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.391
He's with the air force.

109
00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:59.193
Marseille Express,
at your service.

110
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.754
Mr. Cisse has 8 minutes
to get to the game.

111
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.159
Good to have you aboard.

112
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.355
You're playing for Marseille?

113
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.658
A charity game.
We'll miss kick-off.

114
00:06:08.697 --> 00:06:10.959
If it's for a good cause...

115
00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.563
I'll get changed to save time.

116
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.327
You can try.

117
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.533
Guess who's transferred to Marseille.

118
00:06:44.067 --> 00:06:46.727
This is the wrong way.
The city's gridlocked.

119
00:06:46.768 --> 00:06:48.324
No kidding! Djibril Cisse himself!

120
00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.333
Number 9 for Olympique de Marseille.

121
00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:04.130
That's what I call a road.

122
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:08.095
Like velvet.

123
00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.397
Can't even hear the engine.

124
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:12.697
At this speed, only wind.

125
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.598
News has just come in

126
00:07:16.637 --> 00:07:18.001
that Marseille has broken the bank
to buy a wonder player,

127
00:07:18.038 --> 00:07:20.799
none other than Djibril Cisse.

128
00:07:24.438 --> 00:07:26.304
There's a taxi coming your way.

129
00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:28.099
ETA less than one minute.

130
00:07:28.138 --> 00:07:29.798
Got ya!

131
00:07:30.338 --> 00:07:31.804
It must be Daniel.

132
00:07:31.838 --> 00:07:34.100
It ain't gonna be the pope.

133
00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:35.298
The Parisian?

134
00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:36.396
Jeez, that's mean.

135
00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.405
He has to learn sometime.

136
00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:41.270
- Hey, Blondie!
- Yes, sir?

137
00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:44.863
Can you check the radar over there?

138
00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:46.371
Switch it to ultra-sensitive, will you?

139
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.872
Sir, yes, sir!

140
00:07:48.607 --> 00:07:53.472
Watch out, bullet train approaching.
Stand back!

141
00:07:59.408 --> 00:08:03.568
Thanks, kid.
We got a much better reading.

142
00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:10.373
- It really goes.
- I customized it.

143
00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:12.671
Picked up parts from Concorde.

144
00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:14.471
Brake! We're nearly there.

145
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:19.943
We just received confirmation.
60 million!

146
00:08:28.778 --> 00:08:29.937
The transfer of the year!
There's traffic everywhere.

147
00:08:29.978 --> 00:08:31.739
I know a shortcut.

148
00:08:31.778 --> 00:08:34.244
I hate it when you say that.

149
00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:40.636
The wildest rumors surround

150
00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.440
the transfer of Djibril Cisse
to Olympique de Marseille.

151
00:08:43.478 --> 00:08:47.911
To find out more, over to
Armand Pecci at the Velodrome.

152
00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:50.605
Absolutely, we're here live in Marseille

153
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.407
for the fund-raiser for
a sick children's charity.

154
00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:58.503
The player has asked
for an astronomical sum.

155
00:08:58.547 --> 00:09:02.309
Figures of up to 200 million euros
have been mentioned.

156
00:09:02.347 --> 00:09:05.212
He'll reveal all to us
later live on TF1,

157
00:09:05.248 --> 00:09:07.214
but for now he's not even arrived.

158
00:09:07.248 --> 00:09:10.612
Djibril Cisse or not,
we kick off in 2 minutes.

159
00:09:15.948 --> 00:09:16.709
Take a right.

160
00:09:16.748 --> 00:09:19.306
That's two "rights" already?

161
00:09:19.349 --> 00:09:20.212
You sure you been here before?

162
00:09:20.249 --> 00:09:22.977
Papal security.

163
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.982
We spent 6 days here
looking for Gibert.

164
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.982
That's reassuring.
How about we trust my instinct?

165
00:09:31.016 --> 00:09:32.482
OK, let's go!

166
00:09:41.217 --> 00:09:43.183
- 7' 32".
- Thanks.

167
00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:44.979
Thank you.

168
00:10:04.486 --> 00:10:06.645
This is better than on TV.

169
00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:08.244
You're kind of in the way.
Back to the stands,

170
00:10:08.287 --> 00:10:11.151
or it's a yellow card.

171
00:10:11.187 --> 00:10:12.948
Yes, ref.

172
00:10:50.957 --> 00:10:53.219
- What are you doing?
- That's a free kick.

173
00:11:02.259 --> 00:11:04.384
- That wasn't a fair play!
- Leave him alone!

174
00:11:53.897 --> 00:11:57.762
Let's warm up good!
Lift your knees. I want no strains.

175
00:12:10.598 --> 00:12:12.530
- Like the shirt?
- It's too big.

176
00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.531
You know your Mom.

177
00:12:14.565 --> 00:12:17.031
After the first wash,

178
00:12:17.066 --> 00:12:18.327
The autograph'll wash off.

179
00:12:18.366 --> 00:12:21.128
I'll ask her to wash round it.

180
00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:22.030
Listen to me.

181
00:12:22.067 --> 00:12:25.829
Stay on the pitch more than
3 minutes. No red cards.

182
00:12:25.866 --> 00:12:27.332
Are you OK?

183
00:12:28.467 --> 00:12:31.627
The golden rule
is you don't go near the ball.

184
00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:32.325
Yes.

185
00:12:32.367 --> 00:12:34.833
If it comes to you,
just kick it.

186
00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:35.628
Which way?

187
00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:38.031
Just kick.
They can chase it.

188
00:12:38.068 --> 00:12:40.227
Can't I play a bit, though?

189
00:12:40.268 --> 00:12:42.791
When the match is over, with me.

190
00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:46.494
Go on, son!

191
00:12:46.868 --> 00:12:48.698
Don't run too fast.

192
00:12:58.036 --> 00:12:59.696
Sure he won't catch cold?

193
00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:02.999
I gave him a thermal undershirt
and vitamin C earlier.

194
00:13:03.037 --> 00:13:05.299
Like that, not much can go wrong.

195
00:13:05.337 --> 00:13:07.802
Get him playing ice hockey.

196
00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:09.497
Too dangerous!

197
00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:11.401
His Mom wanted him to do karate.

198
00:13:11.438 --> 00:13:14.962
I had a word with the club.
They turned him down.

199
00:13:15.038 --> 00:13:18.061
He's gonna have to learn
to take a hit some time.

200
00:13:18.138 --> 00:13:20.161
Yeah, it'll be too soon.

201
00:13:20.238 --> 00:13:21.169
Try swimming.

202
00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:24.467
He has a bad chest.
It's hereditary.

203
00:13:24.505 --> 00:13:26.767
You never broke anything as a kid?

204
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.965
- My arm. 3 times.
- You see?

205
00:13:29.006 --> 00:13:32.564
It didn't make me any smarter
or get me into cop school.

206
00:13:33.707 --> 00:13:36.071
You shoulda tried breaking a leg.

207
00:13:38.207 --> 00:13:41.173
Well played, son, that's right!

208
00:13:43.507 --> 00:13:46.065
What'll happen to our kids?

209
00:13:46.108 --> 00:13:47.165
Whaddya mean?

210
00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:49.538
Mine a cabbie
and yours a cop?

211
00:13:49.608 --> 00:13:52.233
Why not? They'd be doing well.

212
00:13:52.308 --> 00:13:54.137
We help people.
Pretty neat, huh?

213
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.232
Don't complain, there's worse.

214
00:13:56.276 --> 00:13:58.333
Mine a cabbie and yours a cop!

215
00:13:58.376 --> 00:14:00.137
Don't even mention it.

216
00:14:05.976 --> 00:14:07.441
This is Emilien.

217
00:14:08.776 --> 00:14:11.140
- Emilien?
- An emergency?

218
00:14:11.177 --> 00:14:13.939
Gibert said that?
I'm off duty today.

219
00:14:13.977 --> 00:14:14.943
Emilien...

220
00:14:14.977 --> 00:14:16.136
You okay, Maxime?

221
00:14:16.178 --> 00:14:18.541
- You're kidding me!
- I think you oughta...

222
00:14:18.577 --> 00:14:20.134
OK, I'll be right there.

223
00:14:20.178 --> 00:14:22.701
Gibert's called everybody in.

224
00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:24.710
Petra's on an ultra-secret mission.

225
00:14:24.778 --> 00:14:26.903
And my Mom's gone to Lourdes.

226
00:14:26.978 --> 00:14:27.602
Lourdes?

227
00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:29.009
She goes since I was born.

228
00:14:29.045 --> 00:14:30.704
That was some miracle!

229
00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:33.507
- You'll take care of the kids?
- No problem.

230
00:14:33.546 --> 00:14:35.603
Don't fill his face with cakes.

231
00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:39.204
Would I? Crust of bed,
glass of water and to bed!

232
00:14:39.246 --> 00:14:41.905
Joke!
I'll look after him like my own.

233
00:14:41.946 --> 00:14:43.105
That scares me.

234
00:14:43.146 --> 00:14:45.408
I look after your son every Wednesday.

235
00:14:45.447 --> 00:14:48.902
Has he ever come home with pimples?

236
00:14:48.947 --> 00:14:50.606
So, get moving.

237
00:14:50.647 --> 00:14:52.113
Thank you.

238
00:14:53.548 --> 00:14:55.275
4' 30".
You beat your record.

239
00:14:55.347 --> 00:14:57.176
I didn't touch him!

240
00:14:57.247 --> 00:15:00.873
Stinky ref!
Hands out cards like confetti.

241
00:15:01.715 --> 00:15:03.874
Get Max.
We'll go eat waffles.

242
00:15:03.915 --> 00:15:05.973
C'mon, Max, let's go eat.

243
00:15:11.516 --> 00:15:13.981
Arrest that ball immediately!

244
00:15:14.216 --> 00:15:15.477
I got it, chief!

245
00:15:15.516 --> 00:15:17.482
Bring it over here.

246
00:15:21.917 --> 00:15:23.474
Won't bother me again.

247
00:15:24.517 --> 00:15:26.380
Here, kids, enjoy your game.

248
00:15:28.918 --> 00:15:31.941
This is no time for dribbles,

249
00:15:32.018 --> 00:15:34.450
stepovers and other football clownery.

250
00:15:34.485 --> 00:15:36.041
I had Paris on the phone.

251
00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:39.052
They're sending a very special delivery.

252
00:15:39.086 --> 00:15:41.847
The most important transfer
of the year.

253
00:15:41.885 --> 00:15:42.942
- Drogba?
- Thuram?

254
00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.246
I know! Makelele!

255
00:15:44.286 --> 00:15:45.650
- Beckenbauer?
- Maradona?

256
00:15:45.686 --> 00:15:48.846
What a bunch of idiots!

257
00:15:48.886 --> 00:15:50.852
I'm not talking tennis,
I'm talking crime.

258
00:15:50.886 --> 00:15:51.852
Bernard Tapie!

259
00:15:51.886 --> 00:15:54.444
Much more famous than him.

260
00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:57.146
On my files,
he's public enemy No. 1

261
00:15:57.187 --> 00:16:03.814
It's none other than
Jeeycee Kassa-see...

262
00:16:03.887 --> 00:16:04.512
- Jeeycee Kassa-see...
- No, chief.

263
00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:06.315
Attention!

264
00:16:06.388 --> 00:16:08.115
That was yesterday's transfer.

265
00:16:08.154 --> 00:16:09.814
Where's today's?

266
00:16:09.855 --> 00:16:11.821
Turn the page.
Save paper, remember?

267
00:16:11.855 --> 00:16:13.014
Yes, indeed.

268
00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.112
It's my wife.

269
00:16:14.155 --> 00:16:16.814
She saw a program
on the Amazon forest.

270
00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:20.413
Know how many hectares
are cut down every year?

271
00:16:23.456 --> 00:16:25.218
How many?

272
00:16:25.656 --> 00:16:28.623
It sends shivers down your spine.

273
00:16:28.657 --> 00:16:29.623
How many?

274
00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:35.090
Like billions of matchboxes,
chopped down and up in flames.

275
00:16:35.157 --> 00:16:38.089
So, at the first chance,
I say, show me your papers!

276
00:16:38.157 --> 00:16:40.589
I mean, save paper!

277
00:16:40.658 --> 00:16:42.590
What about public enemy No. 1?

278
00:16:42.624 --> 00:16:44.886
A Belgian whose name is enough
to make you feel sick.

279
00:16:44.925 --> 00:16:49.790
53 armed robberies,
122 accomplice-to-murder raps.

280
00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:53.281
Biggest mobster since AI Capone.

281
00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:57.883
He's being transferred to Congo
to stand trial for dozens of crimes.

282
00:16:57.926 --> 00:16:59.483
Stopover in Marseille.

283
00:16:59.526 --> 00:17:02.185
We take delivery,
keep him warm

284
00:17:02.226 --> 00:17:03.988
till 5 a.m. tomorrow

285
00:17:04.027 --> 00:17:06.788
and put him in the Congolese jet.

286
00:17:06.827 --> 00:17:09.555
He's not gonna see any sights.

287
00:17:10.327 --> 00:17:13.350
I want ultra-tight surveillance.

288
00:17:13.427 --> 00:17:16.155
An officer every square centimeter.

289
00:17:16.195 --> 00:17:19.161
So many cops, so close,
he can't even see the sea.

290
00:17:19.195 --> 00:17:21.753
- Do I make myself hear?
- Yes, chief!

291
00:17:21.795 --> 00:17:24.352
What time's he get in?

292
00:17:24.795 --> 00:17:27.261
Good question.
15:00 hours.

293
00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.159
It's already 5 past.

294
00:17:29.196 --> 00:17:31.162
5 past 12?

295
00:17:32.296 --> 00:17:34.762
To the cars!

296
00:17:34.796 --> 00:17:37.354
What's up?
Isn't that what you ordered?

297
00:17:37.397 --> 00:17:38.454
Eat then.

298
00:17:38.497 --> 00:17:42.224
Dad said not to eat cream
'cos I get it all over.

299
00:17:42.297 --> 00:17:43.524
Well, he's wrong.

300
00:17:43.597 --> 00:17:46.427
Show him what a good eater you are.

301
00:17:53.565 --> 00:17:55.122
Shit! Your Dad! The cops!

302
00:17:55.165 --> 00:17:58.722
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!

303
00:17:58.765 --> 00:18:01.823
The lady's got a flat.

304
00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:04.730
I gotta help in this heat.

305
00:18:04.766 --> 00:18:06.732
He's right. She'll dehydrate.
She needs help.

306
00:18:06.766 --> 00:18:08.732
- I can do first aid!
- I used to be a florist.

307
00:18:08.766 --> 00:18:11.232
Stop! Stay where you are!

308
00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:19.995
Some parents deserve
to be sent to jail.

309
00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:23.090
How long does it take
to change a tire?

310
00:18:23.134 --> 00:18:25.692
Here, we take the time
to do things right.

311
00:18:27.334 --> 00:18:27.993
Thank you.

312
00:18:28.035 --> 00:18:30.899
About time, too.
Drive!

313
00:18:40.736 --> 00:18:42.498
Tasty, at least?

314
00:18:54.104 --> 00:18:55.161
General!

315
00:18:55.204 --> 00:18:56.465
Gibert! That explains it.

316
00:18:56.504 --> 00:18:59.959
We took a shortcut,
but the lady had a flat.

317
00:19:00.004 --> 00:19:01.470
1 hour to change a tire?

318
00:19:01.505 --> 00:19:03.767
In the police, a week at best.

319
00:19:03.805 --> 00:19:06.965
The first thing they learn now
is to shoot.

320
00:19:07.005 --> 00:19:10.767
But cops deal with more flat tires
than shootouts.

321
00:19:10.805 --> 00:19:12.862
Is it the same in the army?

322
00:19:12.905 --> 00:19:15.371
- We have caterpillars.
- They're very good.

323
00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:17.066
Specially off road.

324
00:19:46.275 --> 00:19:49.435
That reminds me
of a vacation in Africa.

325
00:19:49.476 --> 00:19:53.636
We slept in cages to keep
the wild beasts away.

326
00:19:53.676 --> 00:19:55.609
This is the worst kind of beast.

327
00:19:55.677 --> 00:19:59.609
If he escapes,
there'll be blood on the streets.

328
00:19:59.677 --> 00:20:01.109
Don't worry, General,
we're used to his sort.

329
00:20:01.144 --> 00:20:03.303
2 hours to tame him.

330
00:20:03.344 --> 00:20:07.106
Tomorrow, he'll be juggling
balls on his nose.

331
00:20:07.144 --> 00:20:08.701
Load him up!

332
00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:14.802
Good job!

333
00:20:14.845 --> 00:20:17.903
Your career hangs on this.

334
00:20:17.945 --> 00:20:22.003
It's in the bag.
Let's synchronize watches.

335
00:20:22.046 --> 00:20:23.602
- 16:20.
- 5 past 12. Perfect.

336
00:20:23.645 --> 00:20:26.612
Touch base every 2 hours.
Go!

337
00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.578
Hello.

338
00:20:32.646 --> 00:20:34.272
General! Already?

339
00:20:34.314 --> 00:20:38.371
It's taken you a mere
30 seconds to mess up.

340
00:20:38.414 --> 00:20:40.778
- Sorry?
- Check your mirror.

341
00:20:41.714 --> 00:20:46.374
The label! I can see much
better now. Thank you, General.

342
00:20:46.714 --> 00:20:49.977
I meant your side-view mirror.

343
00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:52.378
Look to your right.

344
00:20:53.715 --> 00:20:57.273
Shit! Reverse engines!

345
00:21:06.716 --> 00:21:10.149
He has the point.

346
00:21:11.383 --> 00:21:12.542
You're sure about the address?

347
00:21:12.584 --> 00:21:14.141
100%.

348
00:21:14.184 --> 00:21:18.742
You stay in the car.
I'll be much happier on my own.

349
00:21:18.784 --> 00:21:20.944
If, and I emphasize the "if",

350
00:21:20.985 --> 00:21:23.042
I'm gone 30 minutes,
come get me.

351
00:21:23.085 --> 00:21:24.846
Yeah, right!

352
00:21:25.685 --> 00:21:27.049
What?

353
00:21:27.586 --> 00:21:31.541
Call me before you unleash him.
To be on the safe side.

354
00:21:31.586 --> 00:21:32.847
No worries.

355
00:21:40.953 --> 00:21:43.511
Gee, he missed it!

356
00:22:21.324 --> 00:22:22.983
Let me see how well you can handle this.

357
00:22:26.824 --> 00:22:28.085
HI, Daniel!

358
00:22:28.125 --> 00:22:30.591
This was on the road.

359
00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:33.182
Is it yours?
I knew it had hit the asphalt.

360
00:22:33.225 --> 00:22:34.282
Thanks.

361
00:22:34.325 --> 00:22:36.689
- Hiya, kids!
- Jeez, they grow up quick.

362
00:22:36.725 --> 00:22:38.987
It's little Maxime!

363
00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:41.253
Lucky, he's not like his Dad.

364
00:22:41.825 --> 00:22:42.450
OK, let's go.

365
00:22:42.526 --> 00:22:44.651
Emilien's out on a mission.

366
00:22:44.726 --> 00:22:46.954
They can play on the computer.

367
00:22:48.193 --> 00:22:50.250
Where are your Dad's video games?

368
00:22:51.594 --> 00:22:53.560
Those'll keep you busy.

369
00:22:53.594 --> 00:22:56.060
I have to make a call. Be good.

370
00:23:00.495 --> 00:23:01.461
Can we both play?

371
00:23:01.495 --> 00:23:04.757
No, they gave Dad the worst computer.

372
00:23:04.795 --> 00:23:06.556
Hardly even sends email.

373
00:23:06.595 --> 00:23:09.255
- And Gibert's?
- It's hot stuff!

374
00:23:09.295 --> 00:23:12.852
What the hell is all this garbage?

375
00:23:12.895 --> 00:23:15.418
Need an MA for the new models!

376
00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.523
- What?
- We wanted to play.

377
00:23:19.596 --> 00:23:21.426
It's taken.
Try another office.

378
00:23:21.463 --> 00:23:22.520
That one's

379
00:23:22.563 --> 00:23:25.927
a CORE2 total latest generation.

380
00:23:29.764 --> 00:23:32.821
- You know how to work this?
- Child's play!

381
00:23:34.164 --> 00:23:35.926
- Hi, Marley.
- How are you!

382
00:23:35.964 --> 00:23:38.022
Got anything for a sore throat?

383
00:23:38.065 --> 00:23:40.530
The season's over. I ain't got much.

384
00:23:40.564 --> 00:23:42.428
Take a look.

385
00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:47.394
Yeah, right.

386
00:23:49.265 --> 00:23:52.096
- You join me?
- Why not!

387
00:23:59.533 --> 00:24:01.692
- It'll wake me up. Here.
- No, thanks.

388
00:24:01.733 --> 00:24:05.097
Not on duty.
I'll smoke it tonight.

389
00:24:05.134 --> 00:24:09.191
Here, it's the opposite.
We never smoke at home.

390
00:24:10.235 --> 00:24:13.201
- It's Gibert!
- Check out the car!

391
00:24:22.535 --> 00:24:24.058
Alain?

392
00:24:24.136 --> 00:24:26.068
Put the beast in the main office.

393
00:24:26.136 --> 00:24:28.159
- Out of the cage?
- Of course not!

394
00:24:28.202 --> 00:24:30.760
May I remind you,
he's extremely dangerous?

395
00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:33.463
I know, but the cage is extremely big.

396
00:24:33.503 --> 00:24:35.470
Stop discussing the discussion.

397
00:24:35.504 --> 00:24:37.163
Action!

398
00:24:40.904 --> 00:24:41.870
All units...

399
00:24:41.904 --> 00:24:44.462
Big bad wolf's back. Over.

400
00:24:44.505 --> 00:24:46.164
That's Gibert! Lose it.

401
00:25:03.372 --> 00:25:05.339
Marley!

402
00:25:05.373 --> 00:25:07.532
- Come here.
- Yes, sir?

403
00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:11.037
- Have you been smoking?
- No, I swear...

404
00:25:11.073 --> 00:25:11.732
Don't lie to me.

405
00:25:11.774 --> 00:25:15.138
I have a very sensitive nose.

406
00:25:15.174 --> 00:25:18.334
I trained with mountain rescue dogs.

407
00:25:18.374 --> 00:25:20.135
I can sniff snow like no man.

408
00:25:20.174 --> 00:25:21.037
It's great.

409
00:25:21.074 --> 00:25:24.041
I could detect grass over a mile away.
Wicked!

410
00:25:24.075 --> 00:25:25.540
I guess so.

411
00:25:25.574 --> 00:25:30.098
I'll let it ride.
Last chance, OK?

412
00:25:34.143 --> 00:25:35.904
Type your password.

413
00:25:39.042 --> 00:25:40.906
Select a photo.

414
00:25:42.943 --> 00:25:46.307
Click on the one you don't want.

415
00:25:47.444 --> 00:25:49.909
Then click on the one you want.

416
00:25:51.944 --> 00:25:54.409
Thanks, boys. I don't know

417
00:25:54.444 --> 00:25:56.501
what I'd have done without you.

418
00:25:56.544 --> 00:25:58.806
You deserve a reward.

419
00:26:00.044 --> 00:26:02.067
A bill for each of you.

420
00:26:04.545 --> 00:26:07.773
Put it away. Our secret.

421
00:26:08.412 --> 00:26:09.968
What are you doing, boys?

422
00:26:10.012 --> 00:26:13.775
I don't want you on my computer.

423
00:26:16.013 --> 00:26:17.774
And what are you doing?

424
00:26:19.313 --> 00:26:21.370
You're the new IT trainer?

425
00:26:23.914 --> 00:26:25.971
- Right.
- Sorry, I'd forgotten.

426
00:26:26.014 --> 00:26:29.276
It's not a luxury
having a teacher for this.

427
00:26:29.314 --> 00:26:34.337
I'm pretty electronically minded,
but I've met my match here.

428
00:26:34.414 --> 00:26:36.040
Short and sweet.

429
00:26:36.115 --> 00:26:39.343
I've had a long day.
Feels like my head'll explode.

430
00:26:39.915 --> 00:26:41.347
Sorry, but you're smoking.

431
00:26:41.382 --> 00:26:43.245
I stopped 3 weeks ago.

432
00:26:43.282 --> 00:26:46.646
I have pretty good willpower,
but this time I resorted to a patch.

433
00:26:46.682 --> 00:26:47.943
- Yes, indeed!
- Great.

434
00:26:49.883 --> 00:26:52.645
I meant, your head's smoking.

435
00:26:52.983 --> 00:26:56.245
- So it is.
- May I?

436
00:26:56.984 --> 00:26:59.041
Where'd that come from?

437
00:26:59.084 --> 00:27:01.642
Morocco, definitely.

438
00:27:01.684 --> 00:27:04.241
Put it out.
It's a no-smoking office.

439
00:27:04.284 --> 00:27:05.443
Sorry.

440
00:27:06.384 --> 00:27:09.215
Can we start?
I have a busy schedule.

441
00:27:09.285 --> 00:27:11.910
Where did you get to
in your last lesson?

442
00:27:11.985 --> 00:27:13.611
Adjusting the chair.

443
00:27:14.752 --> 00:27:16.411
Take the mouse.

444
00:27:16.452 --> 00:27:19.214
One eye on the screen,
one on the keyboard.

445
00:27:19.253 --> 00:27:22.912
One eye on the screen,
one on the keyboard...

446
00:27:32.853 --> 00:27:34.513
This won't be easy.

447
00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:38.315
That's for 6-year-olds?

448
00:27:38.354 --> 00:27:40.479
Dad! It's totally harmless.

449
00:27:40.554 --> 00:27:42.487
We haven't played it for ages.

450
00:27:43.954 --> 00:27:47.387
It's awful.
You have no idea.

451
00:27:47.421 --> 00:27:49.887
No, I never have any ideas.

452
00:27:49.922 --> 00:27:52.888
We got a huge job. A major client!

453
00:27:52.922 --> 00:27:54.979
- What kind?
- Wanted all over Europe.

454
00:27:55.022 --> 00:27:58.284
They sent him here?
He'll learn to play boules.

455
00:27:58.322 --> 00:28:00.481
No time.
He's flying out to Congo at 5 tomorrow.

456
00:28:00.523 --> 00:28:01.580
If he's not escaped.

457
00:28:01.623 --> 00:28:05.283
This isn't a police station,
it's a summer camp.

458
00:28:05.323 --> 00:28:07.585
- Relax.
- If that's not what it was, then it's great.

459
00:28:09.223 --> 00:28:12.587
Gibert wants us all in
to work overtime.

460
00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:15.747
I can't get hold of Petra.

461
00:28:15.824 --> 00:28:18.154
Always some damn top secret mission.

462
00:28:18.224 --> 00:28:20.157
So, I'm stuck with the kid...

463
00:28:20.192 --> 00:28:23.555
And could your friend Daniel
look after him?

464
00:28:23.591 --> 00:28:26.558
Just a couple of hours

465
00:28:26.592 --> 00:28:28.148
until I get off duty.

466
00:28:28.192 --> 00:28:30.351
- 2 sugars in your coffee?
- Thank you.

467
00:28:30.692 --> 00:28:33.658
When do I do any work?
I've had the kids all day.

468
00:28:33.692 --> 00:28:35.158
Can't Lily help out?

469
00:28:35.193 --> 00:28:36.852
She's in Paris
on a decorating course.

470
00:28:36.893 --> 00:28:38.450
Decorating?

471
00:28:38.493 --> 00:28:41.948
She's decided
to redecorate the garage.

472
00:28:42.994 --> 00:28:45.153
- Yikes!
- You said it.

473
00:28:45.194 --> 00:28:47.422
She wants the taxi to sleep outside.

474
00:28:47.494 --> 00:28:49.221
Ouch!

475
00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:50.917
You're a dead man!

476
00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:56.121
It could be a good thing.
Lily puts flowers everywhere.

477
00:28:56.162 --> 00:28:58.628
Pollen blocks up the carburetors.

478
00:28:58.662 --> 00:29:01.219
I spend all weekend
cleaning them with cotton buds.

479
00:29:01.262 --> 00:29:04.320
You have to learn to compromise.

480
00:29:04.363 --> 00:29:05.919
You compromise with Petra?

481
00:29:05.962 --> 00:29:08.428
No kidding.

482
00:29:08.463 --> 00:29:10.929
- For example?
- My clothes.

483
00:29:10.963 --> 00:29:13.225
When I was single,
I never tidied up.

484
00:29:13.264 --> 00:29:16.526
Anything lying around,
Petra threw it out the window.

485
00:29:16.564 --> 00:29:19.121
- Your shorts, too?
- Everything!

486
00:29:20.164 --> 00:29:22.097
So, you learned to be tidier?

487
00:29:22.165 --> 00:29:26.893
I bought a fishing rod.
Saved me 3 flights of stairs.

488
00:29:29.532 --> 00:29:31.498
When can you pick Max up?

489
00:29:31.532 --> 00:29:33.192
In 2 hours.

490
00:29:33.232 --> 00:29:35.095
OK, you have 2 hours.

491
00:29:35.132 --> 00:29:38.098
- You're a pal.
- Yeah, I know.

492
00:29:41.232 --> 00:29:44.199
As it's just us guys tonight,

493
00:29:44.233 --> 00:29:47.597
how about a TV dinner in the garage?

494
00:29:47.633 --> 00:29:49.099
Deal!

495
00:29:51.433 --> 00:29:54.059
You can keep them busy for 2 hours?

496
00:29:54.134 --> 00:29:55.565
I have an idea.

497
00:29:56.434 --> 00:29:59.264
- Granddad!
- My little soldiers!

498
00:29:59.334 --> 00:30:01.357
Great to see you!

499
00:30:01.401 --> 00:30:02.867
Wasn't it Sunday?

500
00:30:02.902 --> 00:30:05.868
We were going to see a movie

501
00:30:05.902 --> 00:30:07.368
and they insisted we stop by.

502
00:30:07.402 --> 00:30:09.561
Granddad, I missed you!

503
00:30:09.602 --> 00:30:11.067
I wanna stay with Leo.

504
00:30:11.102 --> 00:30:13.261
My little lambs. I'm here now.

505
00:30:13.302 --> 00:30:17.065
Granddad's here, don't worry.

506
00:30:17.103 --> 00:30:18.262
They're so sensitive.

507
00:30:18.303 --> 00:30:21.360
Yeah, their mothers are away.

508
00:30:21.403 --> 00:30:23.562
They act hard but they're softies.

509
00:30:25.104 --> 00:30:29.434
Couldn't you let them
stay a few hours?

510
00:30:30.704 --> 00:30:33.135
2 hours, no more!
They have homework.

511
00:30:33.204 --> 00:30:35.534
2 hours. Not a second more!

512
00:30:42.872 --> 00:30:44.735
He's been gone an hour.
Let's go!

513
00:30:44.772 --> 00:30:46.829
Give him 5 more minutes, OK?

514
00:30:46.872 --> 00:30:51.032
Turn it, that's right.
Now, lower it. Faster...

515
00:30:51.072 --> 00:30:52.333
Faster?

516
00:30:52.373 --> 00:30:55.533
Turn it...
That's right. Not bad.

517
00:30:55.573 --> 00:30:57.539
You gotta get the rhythm.

518
00:30:57.573 --> 00:30:58.335
We're done, chief.

519
00:30:58.374 --> 00:31:00.805
Very clever!

520
00:31:00.873 --> 00:31:02.703
- You lost me the game.
- Yes.

521
00:31:02.774 --> 00:31:05.002
Not bad for a first try.

522
00:31:05.073 --> 00:31:06.801
What's my score?

523
00:31:11.341 --> 00:31:13.307
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

524
00:31:13.341 --> 00:31:13.500
Hello?

525
00:31:13.542 --> 00:31:15.405
It's Sukk. We coming in?

526
00:31:15.441 --> 00:31:19.204
No, there's no need.
I'm done. I'll be right there.

527
00:31:19.242 --> 00:31:20.503
OK, cool.

528
00:31:20.542 --> 00:31:22.406
- What did he say?
- Shut up.

529
00:31:22.442 --> 00:31:24.601
Sorry, I have to go.

530
00:31:24.643 --> 00:31:25.506
You do?

531
00:31:25.543 --> 00:31:27.304
I have a client waiting.

532
00:31:27.342 --> 00:31:30.002
See you next month, same time?

533
00:31:30.043 --> 00:31:31.407
With pleasure.

534
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.768
What have you done?
Are you nuts?

535
00:31:45.812 --> 00:31:47.368
You said the main office.

536
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:49.673
I didn't argue.
An order's an order.

537
00:31:49.711 --> 00:31:52.075
Very true.
You've done well, Alain.

538
00:31:58.412 --> 00:32:01.174
Lose the cover.
We're not here to mollycoddle him.

539
00:32:09.413 --> 00:32:11.436
It's pretty scary.

540
00:32:12.314 --> 00:32:14.542
- Is he really so nasty?
- Even worse.

541
00:32:14.581 --> 00:32:17.046
He'd kill a sheep with his ears.

542
00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.047
Don't be afraid, young Emilien.

543
00:32:19.081 --> 00:32:22.138
I did 5 years in the jungle,

544
00:32:22.182 --> 00:32:23.943
living on spiders and
hippos for UNESCO.

545
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:26.140
A Belgian doesn't scare me.

546
00:32:28.182 --> 00:32:31.444
We'll start
with some routine questions.

547
00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:33.539
Pass me the documents.

548
00:32:33.582 --> 00:32:35.242
Come on!

549
00:32:38.983 --> 00:32:40.915
Full name?

550
00:32:42.184 --> 00:32:44.309
Well? How did it go?

551
00:32:44.384 --> 00:32:46.213
It's a madhouse in there.

552
00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.607
It's freaky.

553
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:50.117
C'mon, drive!

554
00:32:56.151 --> 00:32:57.912
So, he wants to play tough.

555
00:32:57.951 --> 00:32:58.918
The Bouches-du-Rhone.

556
00:32:58.952 --> 00:33:01.009
- Bouches-du-Rhone?
- The special treatment.

557
00:33:02.652 --> 00:33:04.209
Answer the captain!

558
00:33:05.052 --> 00:33:06.712
Calm, everybody.

559
00:33:09.753 --> 00:33:14.879
Think you're smarter than me?
Very well.

560
00:33:14.953 --> 00:33:17.885
In my drawer, my bush rifle.

561
00:33:19.353 --> 00:33:21.581
I brought this back from Guyana.

562
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.177
A gift from the chief.

563
00:33:23.221 --> 00:33:26.278
One dart will put an elephant
to sleep in 5 seconds.

564
00:33:26.321 --> 00:33:28.287
Watch out, it's loaded.

565
00:33:28.321 --> 00:33:31.378
Keep him in your sights.
If he moves again, fire!

566
00:33:31.421 --> 00:33:32.478
No warning shot?

567
00:33:32.521 --> 00:33:37.284
There's only one dart.
How can you fire a warning shot?

568
00:33:37.322 --> 00:33:38.686
My mistake!

569
00:33:39.922 --> 00:33:42.684
Back to the name. Full name?

570
00:33:43.422 --> 00:33:44.888
What's that?

571
00:33:44.923 --> 00:33:49.549
He's getting on my nerves!
That's not a pretty sight, believe me.

572
00:33:49.623 --> 00:33:52.055
It's hard to talk with a ball-gag in.

573
00:33:52.123 --> 00:33:55.352
Excuses!
If he wanted to, he could.

574
00:33:56.191 --> 00:33:58.850
Look, chief.
He's trying to say something.

575
00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.652
Just what we're waiting for.

576
00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:03.348
Say we take out the gag,
just to see?

577
00:34:03.391 --> 00:34:06.449
No! Give him a mile,
he'll take an inch.

578
00:34:06.491 --> 00:34:08.355
That's what the slate's for, then.

579
00:34:08.392 --> 00:34:10.654
- The slate?
- Look!

580
00:34:10.692 --> 00:34:12.851
With a bit of chalk.
It's for him to communicate.

581
00:34:12.892 --> 00:34:14.858
He can write his answers.

582
00:34:14.892 --> 00:34:17.358
Go ahead.
Write! Full name!

583
00:34:17.393 --> 00:34:19.915
He can't talk,
but I think he hears us.

584
00:34:22.293 --> 00:34:23.816
Give him the chalk.

585
00:34:23.893 --> 00:34:26.018
Watch he doesn't eat your leg.

586
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.622
Gently does it.

587
00:34:36.661 --> 00:34:38.321
Very good.

588
00:34:44.962 --> 00:34:46.518
Get out of the way quickly!

589
00:34:55.462 --> 00:34:57.088
What did he write?

590
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.592
- Pipi.
- Pipi?

591
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.596
That his first or last name?

592
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.596
He needs the toilet.

593
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:12.986
Definitely not.

594
00:35:13.031 --> 00:35:14.895
The old toilet ploy.

595
00:35:14.932 --> 00:35:17.796
And he takes off out the window.

596
00:35:17.832 --> 00:35:19.889
I've seen it 100 times.
He thinks we'll fall for that?

597
00:35:19.932 --> 00:35:22.490
You must be kidding me.
They must've planned for this.

598
00:35:23.432 --> 00:35:25.091
Look, there!

599
00:35:25.933 --> 00:35:27.865
Look where?

600
00:35:30.433 --> 00:35:31.864
You know how it works?

601
00:35:31.933 --> 00:35:33.956
Sure! It's child's play.

602
00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:35.863
There's a drainage pipe.

603
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.958
And a clearage pipe. Simple.

604
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:41.761
They showed us a training film
about new equipment.

605
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.767
Forget it.

606
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.259
Hook it up.
Keep him in your sights!

607
00:35:51.801 --> 00:35:54.768
Get some of that! It's wicked.

608
00:36:05.603 --> 00:36:08.330
A bit strong.
I see giant worms.

609
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.134
That connects to the water.

610
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.132
And that goes in the toilet.

611
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.936
Easy!

612
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:23.937
- It's all ready.
- You've scared me!

613
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:25.028
Give me that!

614
00:36:25.071 --> 00:36:26.833
Sorry, I wasn't concentrating.

615
00:36:26.872 --> 00:36:29.031
So, concentrate a bit harder.

616
00:36:29.072 --> 00:36:31.833
Cops don't go playing with guns.

617
00:36:31.872 --> 00:36:35.396
This isn't a funfair,
shooting for teddy bears.

618
00:36:35.472 --> 00:36:37.700
This thing's for real bears.

619
00:36:37.773 --> 00:36:40.205
Rule No. 1, when you're inside,

620
00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:43.001
finger on the trigger guard,

621
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.302
gun held parallel, to avoid accidents.

622
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.399
My foot!

623
00:36:52.841 --> 00:36:56.296
- Quick!
- Grab that chair!

624
00:36:56.341 --> 00:36:59.102
- He's so heavy!
- Put him there! Like carrying 3 people.

625
00:36:59.942 --> 00:37:01.703
Look at the state of him!

626
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:03.298
Did he smoke the carpet?

627
00:37:03.342 --> 00:37:05.899
He took a hit of stuff for bears.

628
00:37:05.942 --> 00:37:07.067
For bears?

629
00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:09.165
- You give him that?
- I gave him nothing.

630
00:37:09.242 --> 00:37:14.266
You morons! It's a dart, full of sedative.

631
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.469
It'd put a bear to sleep.
Wake him or he'll hibernate 6 months.

632
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.874
That'd make 6 quiet months.

633
00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.369
Who signs your leave?

634
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.070
Shit! Chief! Wake up!

635
00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.769
Time to get up!

636
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.867
Red alert!

637
00:37:30.911 --> 00:37:32.774
Where were we?

638
00:37:33.411 --> 00:37:34.968
We'd got to "full name".

639
00:37:35.011 --> 00:37:37.477
All right, don't get
as dumb as Gibert!

640
00:37:37.512 --> 00:37:39.068
Sorry.

641
00:37:39.111 --> 00:37:41.839
Spend all day with him,
it starts to rub off.

642
00:37:41.912 --> 00:37:45.639
Did you enjoy your pee,
my Belgian friend?

643
00:37:45.712 --> 00:37:47.837
You did your Maneken-Piss?

644
00:37:48.979 --> 00:37:50.639
Good one!

645
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.645
OK, enough.

646
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.442
He needed it.
Look at his legs.

647
00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.343
That shouldn't happen.

648
00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.144
It should drain away.

649
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.646
Looks like it's rising.

650
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:07.045
Impossible.
The water should run off.

651
00:38:07.081 --> 00:38:09.047
Maybe you got the pipes mixed up.
I know I often do,

652
00:38:09.081 --> 00:38:11.138
but I took extra care.

653
00:38:11.181 --> 00:38:14.409
Drainage and clearage.

654
00:38:14.481 --> 00:38:16.311
It's not that then.

655
00:38:16.481 --> 00:38:18.607
We have a problem.

656
00:38:21.749 --> 00:38:24.011
I think I'd better check.

657
00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:30.907
I mixed them up again!

658
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.008
What an idiot!

659
00:38:36.251 --> 00:38:37.807
I don't believe it!
Is the water going down?

660
00:38:37.851 --> 00:38:38.714
Sure, look.

661
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:41.717
He had geysers for eyes.
Now, it's a trickle.

662
00:38:41.751 --> 00:38:43.614
Let's get him out before he drowns.

663
00:38:43.651 --> 00:38:47.583
No way, he's dangerous.
Don't fool with him.

664
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:50.584
If the Belgian drowns right here,
who's the fool?

665
00:38:50.652 --> 00:38:52.277
It'd be like we killed him.

666
00:38:53.819 --> 00:38:56.376
There must be
a fast-release system.

667
00:38:56.419 --> 00:38:59.580
Look for a switch or a lever.

668
00:38:59.819 --> 00:39:01.581
A chain?

669
00:39:01.819 --> 00:39:05.082
A handle!
Quick, grab yours.

670
00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:07.779
Ready?
1, 2, 3...

671
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:16.678
He looks in a bad way.

672
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:18.778
Let's take his hood off.

673
00:39:18.821 --> 00:39:19.548
No, you do it.

674
00:39:19.621 --> 00:39:21.554
- Why me?
- Move it!

675
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.249
- It's a tight fit.
- Take it easy.

676
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.154
That's funny.

677
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.247
He's not how I imagined.

678
00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:43.846
Oh, yeah?

679
00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:48.846
I thought he'd have a face, y'know,
with huge teeth and jaws...

680
00:39:48.891 --> 00:39:50.550
- A real yeti?
- More or less.

681
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:53.524
The meanest killers
look totally normal.

682
00:39:53.592 --> 00:39:55.524
Wake him up.

683
00:39:57.792 --> 00:39:58.519
What the heck?

684
00:39:58.592 --> 00:39:59.922
Precautions.

685
00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:10.919
Sir?

686
00:40:11.659 --> 00:40:14.319
Wake up!

687
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.622
- There, he's better!
- That's great.

688
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.717
I'm pleased.

689
00:40:26.761 --> 00:40:27.488
Where am I?

690
00:40:27.561 --> 00:40:29.993
Marseille central police station.

691
00:40:33.229 --> 00:40:35.491
And you guys are cops?

692
00:40:37.529 --> 00:40:39.495
Soon we'll be lieutenants.

693
00:40:39.529 --> 00:40:41.995
You'll be lieutenants soon?

694
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.489
- Bouches-du-Rhone?
- Flyswatter, first.

695
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:50.894
Stop hitting me!

696
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.691
- Stop!
- Listen...

697
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.890
There's been a terrible mistake

698
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.488
that is the fault of
the police in my country.

699
00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:11.256
Albert Vandenbosh,
wanted by Interpol,

700
00:41:11.298 --> 00:41:13.764
convicted in 17 countries.
Remember?

701
00:41:13.799 --> 00:41:14.958
Of course.
That's the problem.

702
00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:17.465
I'm not Vandenbosh,

703
00:41:17.499 --> 00:41:21.159
but Eugene Triboulet, embassy attaché.

704
00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.462
He's trying to con us.

705
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.965
1987. The Paris-Bruges train heist.

706
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.466
I've committed no crime.
I'm an attaché.

707
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:33.933
You're a hell of a case!
Don't try to fool us.

708
00:41:34.001 --> 00:41:37.024
Let's knock out a report for the chief.

709
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:38.533
He'll enjoy reading it.

710
00:41:38.602 --> 00:41:40.033
I'll get on it.

711
00:41:40.068 --> 00:41:41.625
Take this down.

712
00:41:41.668 --> 00:41:43.429
Albert Vandenbosh...

713
00:41:43.468 --> 00:41:44.934
Eugene Triboulet!

714
00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:47.730
I met Vandenbosh.
Look at his photo.

715
00:41:47.768 --> 00:41:50.132
I don't look anything like him.
He's a thug! Yeah, right.

716
00:41:51.469 --> 00:41:53.026
Emilien?

717
00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.933
Take a look.

718
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.937
Who's that?

719
00:42:00.971 --> 00:42:02.630
Albert Vandenbosh.

720
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:03.829
See? I told you.

721
00:42:03.871 --> 00:42:06.497
I know it's not your fault.
Release me

722
00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:08.594
and I won't sue.

723
00:42:09.871 --> 00:42:11.497
How'd you know Vandenbosh?

724
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:13.594
I don't actually know him.

725
00:42:13.638 --> 00:42:15.604
I saw him at Bruges police station.

726
00:42:15.638 --> 00:42:17.195
What were you doing?

727
00:42:17.239 --> 00:42:18.500
Making a complaint.

728
00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:20.402
I'd been carjacked.

729
00:42:20.439 --> 00:42:20.803
What?

730
00:42:20.839 --> 00:42:22.998
They carjacked my Toyota.

731
00:42:23.039 --> 00:42:25.698
Dragged me out and drove away.

732
00:42:25.739 --> 00:42:28.399
In Marseille,
it's called a Parisian.

733
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.406
We call it carjacking!

734
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.201
- Carjacking...
- Carjacking...

735
00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.399
OK, what happened next?

736
00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.998
I was in the chief's office.
Charming man...

737
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.370
When I had to go to the toilet.

738
00:42:39.441 --> 00:42:41.464
You're always peeing!

739
00:42:41.641 --> 00:42:43.573
Yes, since my prostate operation.

740
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:45.869
- Sorry.
- Then what?

741
00:42:46.608 --> 00:42:49.370
In the stalls,
I ran into Vandenbosh,

742
00:42:49.408 --> 00:42:51.374
shucking that horrible suit.

743
00:42:51.408 --> 00:42:53.670
3 thugs jumped on me

744
00:42:53.709 --> 00:42:55.868
and forced me inside there.

745
00:42:55.909 --> 00:42:57.568
I put up a fight,

746
00:42:57.609 --> 00:42:59.973
but they soon gagged me

747
00:43:00.009 --> 00:43:01.066
and from then on

748
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:03.371
I was powerless to resist.

749
00:43:03.409 --> 00:43:05.466
You're very good.

750
00:43:05.509 --> 00:43:08.669
But unfortunately for you,
you've met your match.

751
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:10.370
- Emilien?
- What now?

752
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:11.966
Check this out.

753
00:43:19.378 --> 00:43:21.037
Belgian Embassy
Fenimore Eugene Tribloulet.

754
00:43:21.078 --> 00:43:23.636
Cultural attaché, Belgian Embassy.
Since 1996.

755
00:43:23.678 --> 00:43:27.440
Since May 17, 1996, to be precise.

756
00:43:27.478 --> 00:43:30.138
My appointment even got
a mention on the RTBF news.

757
00:43:30.179 --> 00:43:32.645
- Is there a phone number?
- There.

758
00:43:32.679 --> 00:43:34.144
Call them up.

759
00:43:34.179 --> 00:43:35.440
Action!

760
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.146
Belgian Embassy,
how can I help?

761
00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.339
Mr. Triboulet, please?

762
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.903
Sorry, he's been away for 3 days.

763
00:43:47.981 --> 00:43:51.311
You don't know where he's gone?

764
00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:53.108
To be honest, no.

765
00:43:53.147 --> 00:43:57.603
He hasn't called in at all and
the whole Embassy's worried about him.

766
00:43:57.648 --> 00:43:58.807
He's disappeared?

767
00:43:58.848 --> 00:44:01.508
It seems so.
He was in Bruges in Tuesday

768
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:04.515
and got his car carjacked.

769
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:07.413
Since then, no news of him.

770
00:44:07.449 --> 00:44:10.813
- Are you a relation?
- No.

771
00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:13.409
That's awful.

772
00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.314
Thanks, I'll call back.

773
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.276
What a balls-up!

774
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.877
Talk, damn you!

775
00:44:24.351 --> 00:44:26.579
Take it easy!

776
00:44:26.618 --> 00:44:28.481
I have my eye on them.

777
00:44:28.517 --> 00:44:31.483
Don't burn the place down.

778
00:44:31.517 --> 00:44:34.678
Nobody got any clothes
for our prisoner?

779
00:44:34.719 --> 00:44:38.082
Check the closet.
The boss always keeps spares.

780
00:44:39.719 --> 00:44:42.776
No kidding.
He can change 10 times a day.

781
00:44:43.719 --> 00:44:46.277
Daniel! Good timing.

782
00:44:46.319 --> 00:44:47.285
Is there a problem?

783
00:44:47.319 --> 00:44:50.285
I'd like it if you could
sign the armistice.

784
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:56.950
Die!

785
00:45:02.288 --> 00:45:03.651
Get lost!

786
00:45:03.687 --> 00:45:05.244
Check this out.

787
00:45:07.688 --> 00:45:08.847
Great!

788
00:45:08.889 --> 00:45:12.344
I'd rather die in glory
than surrender in shame.

789
00:45:14.588 --> 00:45:16.350
What's that?

790
00:45:19.289 --> 00:45:21.847
Peace! War's over!

791
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:28.822
Okay, General?

792
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:31.220
I'm fine.

793
00:45:32.557 --> 00:45:36.217
I may have lost a battle,
but I haven't lost the war.

794
00:45:36.258 --> 00:45:40.213
Can the rematch wait?
They have homework to do.

795
00:45:40.258 --> 00:45:43.316
Yes, of course.
On Sunday, perhaps.

796
00:45:43.358 --> 00:45:44.824
That's right. The Lord's Day!

797
00:45:44.858 --> 00:45:46.222
He'll be delighted.

798
00:45:46.259 --> 00:45:50.715
And we'll have apple pie.

799
00:45:50.759 --> 00:45:52.224
I'll take care of it.

800
00:45:52.259 --> 00:45:54.226
You two, in the car!

801
00:45:55.959 --> 00:45:59.392
2 quiet hours?
You destroyed his living room!

802
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.892
He started it.
We wanted to play drafts.

803
00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.188
He said only swishes play drafts.

804
00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:06.692
Swishes? He said that?

805
00:46:06.827 --> 00:46:08.487
You know what swishes do?

806
00:46:08.527 --> 00:46:10.992
Sure.
It's when you squish flies.

807
00:46:11.027 --> 00:46:14.391
Dad says they never stop swishing at work.

808
00:46:18.328 --> 00:46:22.192
The flies have been bulking up.
They're bigger than bees.

809
00:46:24.428 --> 00:46:26.485
He's well-built, your chief.

810
00:46:26.528 --> 00:46:29.689
He's bulky, all right. But it suits you.

811
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.287
Not quite my style, but it'll do.

812
00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:34.159
Better than that diving suit!

813
00:46:34.229 --> 00:46:35.957
For sure.

814
00:46:41.297 --> 00:46:44.162
Look at the size of that one!

815
00:46:47.497 --> 00:46:48.861
- What are you on?
- Sorry!

816
00:46:48.898 --> 00:46:52.558
There was a fly right there.
It was gigantic!

817
00:46:53.398 --> 00:46:57.161
Giant flies and worms, I know.
Take some herb tea.

818
00:46:57.199 --> 00:46:58.755
I swear! Where'd it go?

819
00:46:58.999 --> 00:47:01.761
You're compulsive squishers!

820
00:47:01.799 --> 00:47:03.162
You got us wrong.

821
00:47:03.199 --> 00:47:06.825
It's because our chief
loves fly-fishing, you see?

822
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:11.526
It's his birthday soon,
so we're collecting for him.

823
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.930
It's a surprise.

824
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.826
Sorry, excuse me.

825
00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.924
Can we give you a ride?

826
00:47:18.967 --> 00:47:21.831
No, I'll take a cab.

827
00:47:22.768 --> 00:47:24.529
Goodbye.

828
00:47:24.968 --> 00:47:26.627
Our apologies, huh?

829
00:47:31.369 --> 00:47:33.335
- Denial, are you here?
- Is Emilien done?

830
00:47:33.369 --> 00:47:35.232
Another hour.

831
00:47:35.269 --> 00:47:38.531
Tell him I'll get the pizzas
and meet him at mine.

832
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:39.899
Okay, I'll tell him.

833
00:47:39.969 --> 00:47:41.401
- Bye.
- Thanks.

834
00:47:50.337 --> 00:47:53.098
Fine timing!
I need a means of transport.

835
00:47:53.137 --> 00:47:54.797
Where can I transport you?

836
00:47:54.838 --> 00:47:56.497
4, Mediterranean Square.

837
00:47:56.537 --> 00:47:57.298
Nice address.

838
00:47:57.337 --> 00:47:59.394
- Can I ask a favor?
- Your wishes...

839
00:47:59.437 --> 00:48:01.801
I know you go at your own pace here

840
00:48:01.838 --> 00:48:04.100
because the sun makes you sleepy,

841
00:48:04.138 --> 00:48:06.297
but the sun's gone down,

842
00:48:06.338 --> 00:48:08.100
so I don't want to see the sights.

843
00:48:08.139 --> 00:48:10.105
Would you kindly floor it
to make the transport brief?

844
00:48:10.139 --> 00:48:12.571
Get it? Transport, port?

845
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.071
Marseille port?

846
00:48:15.139 --> 00:48:16.070
Not bad, huh?

847
00:48:16.139 --> 00:48:18.765
Belt up, smartass!

848
00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.363
I beg your pardon.

849
00:48:22.207 --> 00:48:25.264
- Gross!
- That stinks!

850
00:48:25.307 --> 00:48:27.569
I apologize.

851
00:48:27.607 --> 00:48:29.470
You got it all over me!

852
00:48:32.908 --> 00:48:34.374
Have fun in Marseille!

853
00:48:34.408 --> 00:48:35.772
Goodbye, ma'am.

854
00:48:44.609 --> 00:48:47.837
Delta 1. The sardine's in the tin.

855
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.432
Over to you, Delta 3.

856
00:48:49.509 --> 00:48:51.032
10/4. Cast the bait.

857
00:48:54.377 --> 00:48:55.741
Here goes!

858
00:48:55.777 --> 00:48:58.038
It beats that greasy outfit
that stank of sardines.

859
00:48:58.076 --> 00:49:00.542
- You got the gear?
- Everything.

860
00:49:00.577 --> 00:49:01.736
And the specialist?

861
00:49:01.777 --> 00:49:05.733
It wasn't easy finding
good help here. Actually...

862
00:49:05.777 --> 00:49:08.642
Serge! I didn't ask
how great you were,

863
00:49:08.678 --> 00:49:10.541
but if you found a specialist.

864
00:49:10.578 --> 00:49:11.339
The best!

865
00:49:11.378 --> 00:49:13.742
Let me be the judge of that.

866
00:49:13.778 --> 00:49:16.540
Sure. I said you'd want
to see for yourself.

867
00:49:17.879 --> 00:49:19.504
That's him now!

868
00:49:32.446 --> 00:49:34.106
Kiss or shake hands?

869
00:49:34.147 --> 00:49:36.010
I prefer a kiss.

870
00:49:38.047 --> 00:49:40.309
In Belgium, it's 3 times.

871
00:49:42.447 --> 00:49:44.311
I'm honored to work for you.

872
00:49:44.348 --> 00:49:46.507
- You know my work?
- "Work" is too ugly.

873
00:49:46.548 --> 00:49:49.207
I prefer the word "deeds".

874
00:49:49.248 --> 00:49:50.612
She's good!

875
00:49:50.649 --> 00:49:52.013
When do we begin?

876
00:49:52.049 --> 00:49:54.981
Not so fast.
I like flattery,

877
00:49:55.049 --> 00:49:58.277
but I have a little test for you.

878
00:49:59.116 --> 00:50:01.981
I'll close my eyes
and you must try,

879
00:50:02.017 --> 00:50:06.177
if you can, to take something
without me noticing.

880
00:50:06.217 --> 00:50:08.479
You have one minute!

881
00:50:09.717 --> 00:50:11.683
I reset it.

882
00:50:11.717 --> 00:50:13.273
It was a minute slow.

883
00:50:14.318 --> 00:50:17.182
- She's really good.
- Is she in-house?

884
00:50:20.218 --> 00:50:24.276
We've been through all the regions.
He's not interested.

885
00:50:24.318 --> 00:50:26.342
There's only one solution.

886
00:50:26.419 --> 00:50:28.941
- Here's the doc.
- Where's the bear?

887
00:50:32.286 --> 00:50:34.252
His nose is dry.

888
00:50:34.286 --> 00:50:37.741
He's not a bear.
He got a dose of bear tranquilizer.

889
00:50:37.786 --> 00:50:40.946
I thought I'd never seen one like him.

890
00:50:42.086 --> 00:50:43.950
I have an antidote.

891
00:50:43.987 --> 00:50:47.442
It's for elephants,
but it works on bears.

892
00:50:47.488 --> 00:50:48.953
Are you sure about this?

893
00:50:48.987 --> 00:50:50.453
It's a question of aiming

894
00:50:50.488 --> 00:50:54.944
just above the trunk
between the eyes.

895
00:50:56.988 --> 00:50:59.420
I'm right here, chief.

896
00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:00.512
What's wrong with him?

897
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:02.214
It's normal.

898
00:51:02.289 --> 00:51:04.915
He needs to stay in his basket.

899
00:51:06.555 --> 00:51:10.318
I must have dozed off.
What time is it?

900
00:51:10.356 --> 00:51:11.322
5 past 12.

901
00:51:11.356 --> 00:51:14.322
That explains it.
I could eat a horse.

902
00:51:14.356 --> 00:51:15.515
You want pizza?

903
00:51:15.556 --> 00:51:17.419
- I wouldn't say no.
- Coming up.

904
00:51:17.456 --> 00:51:21.116
I had an absurd dream
and you were in it.

905
00:51:21.157 --> 00:51:26.216
You let the Belgian bamboozle you
and he walked free.

906
00:51:26.257 --> 00:51:30.122
I have some weird dreams sometimes.

907
00:51:30.158 --> 00:51:32.124
This can't be...

908
00:51:33.058 --> 00:51:34.388
Emilien?

909
00:51:54.227 --> 00:51:57.887
You won't believe what happened.

910
00:51:57.928 --> 00:52:00.292
- You got fired?
- You know?

911
00:52:00.328 --> 00:52:02.294
You get fired once a month.

912
00:52:02.328 --> 00:52:03.884
This time it's serious.

913
00:52:03.928 --> 00:52:05.554
Remember public enemy No. 1?

914
00:52:05.628 --> 00:52:07.253
The guy transferred via Marseille?

915
00:52:07.328 --> 00:52:08.658
- And?
- I let him walk free.

916
00:52:08.728 --> 00:52:09.853
- This can't be true. I- No.

917
00:52:09.929 --> 00:52:12.361
I mean, he escaped.
I'm such an idiot!

918
00:52:12.396 --> 00:52:13.861
A real numbskull!

919
00:52:13.895 --> 00:52:16.453
It's not just my skull.
All over.

920
00:52:16.496 --> 00:52:18.655
I just keep messing up.

921
00:52:18.696 --> 00:52:21.356
I could write
a dictionary of stupidity.

922
00:52:21.397 --> 00:52:22.657
Don't exaggerate.

923
00:52:22.696 --> 00:52:25.959
You bag some biggies.
The Santa gang? China Girl?

924
00:52:25.996 --> 00:52:27.860
That was just luck!

925
00:52:28.497 --> 00:52:30.054
I'm useless.

926
00:52:30.097 --> 00:52:33.063
Gibert was right to take my badge.
I don't deserve it.

927
00:52:33.097 --> 00:52:34.858
Same goes for most cops.

928
00:52:34.897 --> 00:52:37.363
I became a cop for my Dad's sake.

929
00:52:37.398 --> 00:52:39.523
It was his dying wish.

930
00:52:39.598 --> 00:52:44.031
It's tough, but at least you tried.

931
00:52:44.098 --> 00:52:45.530
Yeah, you're right.

932
00:52:46.265 --> 00:52:50.028
It's time to move on.
Do something I want to do.

933
00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:52.827
That's a positive attitude.

934
00:52:52.866 --> 00:52:55.332
What do you want to do?

935
00:52:55.366 --> 00:52:58.628
That's the problem.
I like my job.

936
00:52:58.667 --> 00:53:00.530
It's the best in the world.

937
00:53:00.566 --> 00:53:03.828
I see. You really are in the shit.

938
00:53:04.067 --> 00:53:06.431
If only I could find the Belgian.

939
00:53:06.467 --> 00:53:08.330
I'd get my badge back.

940
00:53:08.367 --> 00:53:10.027
- What Belgian?
- The perp. He's Belgian.

941
00:53:10.068 --> 00:53:12.795
Big mouth? Fisherman?

942
00:53:14.468 --> 00:53:16.400
Exactly.

943
00:53:16.468 --> 00:53:17.297
Have you seen him?

944
00:53:17.368 --> 00:53:19.596
I picked him up outside the station.

945
00:53:19.635 --> 00:53:22.193
That's him.
He said he'd take a cab.

946
00:53:22.236 --> 00:53:23.792
Pretty spectacular escape.

947
00:53:23.835 --> 00:53:25.597
Was the police band playing?

948
00:53:25.636 --> 00:53:27.602
Do you remember where he went?

949
00:53:27.636 --> 00:53:30.898
- Of course.
- You're a genius!

950
00:53:32.836 --> 00:53:34.200
- Emilien?
- Why?

951
00:53:34.237 --> 00:53:35.998
What about the kids?

952
00:53:37.437 --> 00:53:40.403
Shit! The kids.
You got an idea?

953
00:53:42.537 --> 00:53:45.765
Is it Sunday already?

954
00:53:45.837 --> 00:53:46.768
Sure it is.

955
00:53:46.837 --> 00:53:48.861
Here are the kids,
I'll get the pie.

956
00:53:48.938 --> 00:53:52.064
Fine. I'll put the oven on.

957
00:54:00.506 --> 00:54:03.768
- You're sure it's here?
- Yes. No. 4.

958
00:54:03.806 --> 00:54:05.965
We need to check they're still here.

959
00:54:06.006 --> 00:54:07.563
They are.

960
00:54:07.607 --> 00:54:09.266
Are you sure?
It looks empty.

961
00:54:09.307 --> 00:54:13.763
They're asleep like everybody else,
except us two fools.

962
00:54:15.607 --> 00:54:17.766
Does that mean that I am not normal?

963
00:54:18.408 --> 00:54:20.237
And their car's still there.

964
00:54:20.308 --> 00:54:24.036
You'd have made a good cop.
Is that a compliment?

965
00:54:24.108 --> 00:54:27.131
Sure. As a kid, you must have
played cops and robbers.

966
00:54:27.175 --> 00:54:29.141
Sure, but I was always
on the other team.

967
00:54:29.175 --> 00:54:30.937
If we have work to do tomorrow,
I'll get some sleep.

968
00:54:30.975 --> 00:54:34.238
Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on them.

969
00:54:46.576 --> 00:54:48.338
Emilien?

970
00:54:50.977 --> 00:54:52.705
Sorry, I dozed off.

971
00:54:52.778 --> 00:54:56.904
We have coffee, Quick Burgers,

972
00:54:56.978 --> 00:54:57.705
cheeseburgers, pies... Yogurt.

973
00:54:57.778 --> 00:54:58.801
You had that in the car?

974
00:54:58.844 --> 00:55:00.708
I bought it.

975
00:55:00.745 --> 00:55:03.210
You mean no one
was watching the house?

976
00:55:03.245 --> 00:55:06.803
I was supposed to sleep
while you kept watch.

977
00:55:06.845 --> 00:55:08.811
Your snoring kept me awake.

978
00:55:08.845 --> 00:55:10.902
- Maybe they took off?
- They didn't take off.

979
00:55:10.946 --> 00:55:13.105
The car's still there.

980
00:55:13.146 --> 00:55:16.011
Another arrived an hour ago
with 2 guys in it.

981
00:55:16.047 --> 00:55:17.512
Why didn't you wake me?

982
00:55:17.546 --> 00:55:20.411
You sleeping gives me a break.
Even if you snore.

983
00:55:20.447 --> 00:55:22.811
They're coming out.

984
00:55:25.048 --> 00:55:26.173
There's the Belgian!

985
00:55:26.248 --> 00:55:28.873
It's not him.
Mine was a lot younger.

986
00:55:28.948 --> 00:55:31.176
He's in disguise!

987
00:55:31.248 --> 00:55:33.680
Look, his mustache is dropping off.

988
00:55:34.815 --> 00:55:36.678
Why'd he get dressed up
to leave his own house?

989
00:55:36.715 --> 00:55:38.977
Maybe because the cops
are after him.

990
00:55:39.015 --> 00:55:40.674
Absolutely right.

991
00:55:41.115 --> 00:55:43.673
There's something familiar
about the girl.

992
00:55:51.016 --> 00:55:52.175
Never saw her before.

993
00:56:15.385 --> 00:56:17.647
- Where are they going?
- Guess.

994
00:56:28.187 --> 00:56:31.641
Monaco! Banks all over.
Heaven for a guy like him.

995
00:56:31.687 --> 00:56:33.017
A tax haven, you mean.

996
00:56:33.087 --> 00:56:37.611
Tell me about it. We'd just love
to access some vaults here.

997
00:56:37.688 --> 00:56:39.620
Shall I ask the Belgian to help?

998
00:56:39.654 --> 00:56:42.120
After all you did for him,
he owes you.

999
00:56:42.155 --> 00:56:43.621
Cut it out!

1000
00:56:52.256 --> 00:56:54.222
Here we go...

1001
00:56:54.855 --> 00:56:56.116
He's chosen one.

1002
00:57:05.157 --> 00:57:06.783
Royal Bank of Belgium.

1003
00:57:06.857 --> 00:57:08.288
He must be homesick.

1004
00:57:08.357 --> 00:57:10.187
They're gonna hold it up?

1005
00:57:10.257 --> 00:57:11.985
They're not playing boules.

1006
00:57:12.024 --> 00:57:12.785
I'll call Gibert.

1007
00:57:12.824 --> 00:57:15.586
Shouldn't you wait to have some proof?

1008
00:57:15.625 --> 00:57:17.682
No sweat!
We'll get the proof later.

1009
00:57:17.725 --> 00:57:18.884
Chief? It's Emilien.

1010
00:57:18.925 --> 00:57:21.584
I've got the Belgian.
I've spotted him at least.

1011
00:57:21.625 --> 00:57:24.183
I know I'm not a cop anymore.

1012
00:57:24.225 --> 00:57:26.884
I was taking a walk

1013
00:57:27.626 --> 00:57:29.387
and I saw him enter a bank.

1014
00:57:29.926 --> 00:57:33.790
They're not playing boules.
It's the RBB in Monaco.

1015
00:57:34.626 --> 00:57:36.888
I know it's far.
I'll try to tie them up.

1016
00:57:37.727 --> 00:57:39.750
- He's on his way.
- Great!

1017
00:57:39.827 --> 00:57:41.952
The Joker vs. Scooby-Doo.

1018
00:57:42.127 --> 00:57:44.558
Can I help you?

1019
00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:46.651
I'm here to see my son, Edouard.

1020
00:57:46.695 --> 00:57:48.160
You're Triboulet's father?

1021
00:57:48.194 --> 00:57:50.353
- That's right.
- He'll be so pleased.

1022
00:57:50.394 --> 00:57:52.258
2nd floor, room 115.

1023
00:57:52.294 --> 00:57:53.760
Thank you.

1024
00:57:54.295 --> 00:57:56.852
This way. They're friendly here.

1025
00:57:58.696 --> 00:58:00.559
Come in.

1026
00:58:02.696 --> 00:58:04.060
Dad?

1027
00:58:04.096 --> 00:58:06.062
Idiot! Dad died 4 years ago.

1028
00:58:06.096 --> 00:58:08.062
He'd be ashamed of you

1029
00:58:08.096 --> 00:58:10.153
for changing names.

1030
00:58:10.196 --> 00:58:11.753
Brother...

1031
00:58:12.197 --> 00:58:14.129
- I thought you were in prison.
- Not this week.

1032
00:58:14.197 --> 00:58:16.719
Prison's like a country home.

1033
00:58:16.797 --> 00:58:18.627
I go there to rest up.

1034
00:58:23.664 --> 00:58:26.324
Let's have a look at you.

1035
00:58:27.065 --> 00:58:29.623
Still that stupid haircut.
You never change!

1036
00:58:29.665 --> 00:58:32.631
Girls like men with hair
that's virile.

1037
00:58:32.665 --> 00:58:34.029
A bit like me.

1038
00:58:35.066 --> 00:58:36.622
You're still single?

1039
00:58:36.665 --> 00:58:38.325
Yes.

1040
00:59:00.835 --> 00:59:02.801
Delta 1 in position.

1041
00:59:02.835 --> 00:59:04.994
10/4, Delta 2.

1042
00:59:07.235 --> 00:59:09.497
The girl's going in.

1043
00:59:09.536 --> 00:59:12.195
I know I've seen her before.

1044
00:59:13.336 --> 00:59:14.495
I'm going in.

1045
00:59:14.536 --> 00:59:16.695
Fine, Delta 2.
Got you on visual.

1046
00:59:16.736 --> 00:59:20.567
It's heating up.
What if I take a discreet look?

1047
00:59:20.637 --> 00:59:22.865
You don't do discreet.

1048
00:59:22.937 --> 00:59:25.266
We sit tight and
wait for Scooby-Doo.

1049
00:59:28.603 --> 00:59:29.262
Welcome!

1050
00:59:29.304 --> 00:59:32.464
I'm opening an account
with Mr. Triboulet.

1051
00:59:33.905 --> 00:59:35.666
I'll call him for you.

1052
00:59:42.205 --> 00:59:44.171
Go on, answer it.

1053
00:59:45.505 --> 00:59:48.869
- It's a client?
- Go down.

1054
00:59:48.906 --> 00:59:50.769
I won't get in your way.

1055
00:59:50.806 --> 00:59:52.534
I'll be right down.

1056
00:59:52.606 --> 00:59:54.037
Right away.

1057
00:59:55.106 --> 00:59:58.436
Give me the keys.
I'll go instead of you.

1058
00:59:58.473 --> 01:00:01.440
I only have the keys
to empty boxes.

1059
01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:05.531
I open accounts.

1060
01:00:05.574 --> 01:00:07.437
That's good. Me, too.

1061
01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:15.532
Sorry to keep you waiting, Countess.
This way, please.

1062
01:00:20.076 --> 01:00:22.133
- Open up.
- Yes, Mr. Triboulet.

1063
01:00:29.476 --> 01:00:31.409
After you, Countess.

1064
01:00:46.445 --> 01:00:48.206
Good job!

1065
01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:50.801
It's all yours, Countess.

1066
01:00:55.245 --> 01:00:57.609
Where'd you like to start?

1067
01:00:59.046 --> 01:00:59.773
That wall.

1068
01:00:59.846 --> 01:01:02.676
On that wall, we have No. 82.
How's that suit you?

1069
01:01:03.647 --> 01:01:04.976
Perfectly.

1070
01:01:18.614 --> 01:01:20.171
Are they biting?

1071
01:01:20.215 --> 01:01:22.476
I'm tracking the alarm connections.

1072
01:01:22.514 --> 01:01:25.072
I have to deactivate them

1073
01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:27.081
or it'll go off in Security.

1074
01:01:27.115 --> 01:01:29.377
She blows me away.

1075
01:01:29.415 --> 01:01:33.143
No kidding! How about some food?
I'm starving.

1076
01:01:33.216 --> 01:01:34.738
I'll go find something.

1077
01:01:43.384 --> 01:01:45.941
What's Gibert up to?
It's been an hour.

1078
01:01:45.984 --> 01:01:48.041
- I've spoilt you.
- That's true.

1079
01:01:48.384 --> 01:01:51.350
And an hour to open an account?

1080
01:01:51.384 --> 01:01:53.044
Or several accounts.

1081
01:01:54.385 --> 01:01:56.442
Here's the list of boxes.

1082
01:01:56.485 --> 01:01:59.349
It'll take a while.
Grab a coffee.

1083
01:01:59.385 --> 01:02:00.851
A coffee?

1084
01:02:17.554 --> 01:02:21.009
The Free Belgian?
Pretty classy.

1085
01:02:21.054 --> 01:02:23.111
At your Majesty's service.

1086
01:02:32.855 --> 01:02:34.321
First box open.

1087
01:02:34.356 --> 01:02:36.515
Keep going, Delta 2.

1088
01:02:50.123 --> 01:02:51.089
What?

1089
01:02:51.123 --> 01:02:55.079
A guy in a suit gets into a van
at 9 a.m. Is that normal?

1090
01:02:55.124 --> 01:02:57.681
A Dutch guy getting back
from a club.

1091
01:02:57.724 --> 01:03:00.986
Loaded up with food,
when the van sells Fries?

1092
01:03:01.024 --> 01:03:02.991
Maybe his suck.

1093
01:03:03.025 --> 01:03:04.786
Smart ass.

1094
01:03:04.825 --> 01:03:06.586
That's why I'm a cop.

1095
01:03:13.826 --> 01:03:16.349
Just five left. I need info.

1096
01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:18.255
OK, hold tight a second.

1097
01:03:23.793 --> 01:03:26.055
Number 107. Box 107.

1098
01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:28.560
- 1-0-7.
- 10/4.

1099
01:03:36.594 --> 01:03:38.856
- A black notebook?
- Affirmative.

1100
01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:46.025
- You gave me a fright?
- How's it going?

1101
01:03:46.096 --> 01:03:48.221
- Just five left.
- Let's move it!

1102
01:03:48.296 --> 01:03:49.818
Of course.

1103
01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:54.329
Are you done?

1104
01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:56.420
Getting there.

1105
01:03:56.463 --> 01:03:59.918
His head's smaller than yours, boss.
The wig keeps slipping.

1106
01:03:59.963 --> 01:04:02.225
Stop getting there
and get him out.

1107
01:04:02.263 --> 01:04:03.320
Dumbhead!

1108
01:04:03.364 --> 01:04:06.819
Stop getting there
and get your mustache on.

1109
01:04:06.864 --> 01:04:08.625
I got yelled at.

1110
01:04:08.664 --> 01:04:09.823
- Really?
- I'm true.

1111
01:04:09.864 --> 01:04:12.330
Stopped for lunch?

1112
01:04:12.365 --> 01:04:13.921
Wouldn't surprise me.

1113
01:04:15.565 --> 01:04:17.031
Look!

1114
01:04:18.465 --> 01:04:20.193
We're gonna lose him!

1115
01:04:20.265 --> 01:04:21.196
What?

1116
01:04:21.265 --> 01:04:24.493
He's leaving disguised as an old man.
Where are you?

1117
01:04:24.566 --> 01:04:27.691
The driver's asking for directions.

1118
01:04:27.733 --> 01:04:30.495
But people here run away
when they see a cop.

1119
01:04:30.532 --> 01:04:34.397
And the GPS is on the fritz.
It says "Maubeuge".

1120
01:04:35.734 --> 01:04:38.200
- And now?
- Straight to the beach.

1121
01:04:38.234 --> 01:04:40.597
Watch the sea and count to 100,000.

1122
01:04:40.633 --> 01:04:42.293
- OK, fine.
- Seeya, sucker!

1123
01:04:42.334 --> 01:04:45.391
You're gonna miss him.
He's walking away.

1124
01:04:45.434 --> 01:04:47.297
- It's right there.
- Really?

1125
01:04:49.235 --> 01:04:51.564
What's he wearing?

1126
01:05:00.702 --> 01:05:03.168
- What do we do?
- It's the wrong one.

1127
01:05:03.503 --> 01:05:04.866
I'm not him!

1128
01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:07.767
I'm not me, either.
Take him in!

1129
01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:09.666
I swear I'm not!

1130
01:05:09.703 --> 01:05:11.965
- Emilien?
- Yes, chief?

1131
01:05:12.004 --> 01:05:14.868
Meet me at the office.
I have your badge.

1132
01:05:14.903 --> 01:05:16.563
Thanks, chief.

1133
01:05:16.604 --> 01:05:17.968
Hear that? It's great news!

1134
01:05:18.404 --> 01:05:21.859
All thanks to you.
How can I thank you?

1135
01:05:21.904 --> 01:05:23.268
This stinks.

1136
01:05:23.305 --> 01:05:25.930
No, he's sorry.
He knows I'm a good cop.

1137
01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.938
Not that. The Belgian.

1138
01:05:28.006 --> 01:05:30.528
6 of them in 2 cars with bags.

1139
01:05:30.605 --> 01:05:32.628
And only two come out. On foot.

1140
01:05:32.672 --> 01:05:34.831
How'd you explain that one?

1141
01:05:35.272 --> 01:05:38.136
Nope, that one's a toughie.

1142
01:05:38.172 --> 01:05:40.832
And the old guy's limp was different.

1143
01:05:40.873 --> 01:05:42.634
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

1144
01:05:42.673 --> 01:05:46.231
He maybe fell down some stairs.
Old folks often do.

1145
01:05:46.273 --> 01:05:48.136
It wasn't the same guy.

1146
01:05:49.173 --> 01:05:50.434
Really?

1147
01:05:50.474 --> 01:05:53.441
If that wasn't the Belgian,
where is he?

1148
01:05:54.874 --> 01:05:57.136
Look!

1149
01:05:59.575 --> 01:06:01.098
What a balls-up!

1150
01:06:01.175 --> 01:06:04.198
I'll go a different way.
Meet you at the house.

1151
01:06:04.275 --> 01:06:06.797
No way!
We're in this together.

1152
01:06:06.842 --> 01:06:10.297
Anyway, now I'm rich and single.

1153
01:06:10.342 --> 01:06:12.104
Sounds tempting.

1154
01:06:12.943 --> 01:06:14.602
He won't let her go.

1155
01:06:14.642 --> 01:06:17.200
- We follow them?
- In your fries van?

1156
01:06:19.844 --> 01:06:21.207
What are you waiting for?

1157
01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:22.903
Giving them a start's more fun.

1158
01:06:22.944 --> 01:06:26.308
This is no time for jokes.
Let's go!

1159
01:06:40.712 --> 01:06:42.177
They're going slow!

1160
01:06:42.212 --> 01:06:45.474
Makes a change
to admire the countryside.

1161
01:06:45.512 --> 01:06:47.274
They'll see us.

1162
01:06:47.313 --> 01:06:49.575
We're less obvious than the van.

1163
01:06:50.813 --> 01:06:52.369
Who are those guys?

1164
01:06:52.413 --> 01:06:55.073
Monaco's caviar, not fries.

1165
01:06:55.114 --> 01:06:58.672
When he saw Belgian plates,
he thought he'd get a sale.

1166
01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:02.077
Cut out the jokes!
I'm in deep shit here.

1167
01:07:02.114 --> 01:07:04.273
Why?
You got your card back.

1168
01:07:04.314 --> 01:07:08.145
You think so? Gibert'll find out
it's the wrong Belgian.

1169
01:07:09.315 --> 01:07:12.247
I'm Edouard Triboulet
of the Royal Bank of Belgium.

1170
01:07:12.281 --> 01:07:15.736
And I'm Hercule Poirot.
Where did we get to?

1171
01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:17.748
No. 77, chief.

1172
01:07:17.782 --> 01:07:19.839
That's Seine-et-Marne.

1173
01:07:19.882 --> 01:07:22.644
A beautiful region, you'll see.

1174
01:07:23.383 --> 01:07:25.145
Worth a visit?

1175
01:07:25.183 --> 01:07:27.648
Let's try again. Full name?

1176
01:07:27.683 --> 01:07:31.047
I'm Edouard...

1177
01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:34.050
We're running out of regions, chief.

1178
01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:36.743
We can move onto my encyclopedia
in 22 volumes.

1179
01:07:36.784 --> 01:07:38.807
I'm not so sure...

1180
01:07:38.884 --> 01:07:43.010
I was thinking. He's Belgian,

1181
01:07:43.084 --> 01:07:46.108
so we could try another method.

1182
01:07:46.152 --> 01:07:49.016
- If you see what I mean?
- Good thinking!

1183
01:07:49.052 --> 01:07:51.814
- Everybody out!
- No!

1184
01:07:51.852 --> 01:07:53.512
Please, don't leave me
alone with him!

1185
01:07:53.552 --> 01:07:56.609
Please, stay!

1186
01:08:01.353 --> 01:08:03.410
So, you're Belgian?

1187
01:08:03.453 --> 01:08:05.510
Yes, from Brussels.

1188
01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:12.985
Jacques Brel?
Wasn't he Belgian?

1189
01:08:13.054 --> 01:08:15.782
Yes, a great man. A hero.

1190
01:08:15.855 --> 01:08:17.684
Let's hear the hero.

1191
01:08:34.623 --> 01:08:36.680
Beautiful, isn't it?

1192
01:08:36.723 --> 01:08:39.780
- Wonderful.
- Even better like that!

1193
01:08:40.623 --> 01:08:42.385
Not that! Mercy!

1194
01:08:42.424 --> 01:08:45.948
Stop!

1195
01:08:48.524 --> 01:08:50.956
Not that!

1196
01:08:51.025 --> 01:08:52.651
Full name?

1197
01:08:52.691 --> 01:08:54.953
Help!

1198
01:08:54.991 --> 01:08:57.753
- Tough cookie!
- Regions are easier.

1199
01:09:01.493 --> 01:09:03.049
Shit!

1200
01:09:03.593 --> 01:09:05.956
The fryer's frazzled.

1201
01:09:09.993 --> 01:09:11.050
We're not going to the house?

1202
01:09:11.093 --> 01:09:13.252
We're worth more.

1203
01:09:13.293 --> 01:09:14.759
Call the Colombian.

1204
01:09:22.994 --> 01:09:24.517
The Belgian for you.

1205
01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:25.720
You're out?

1206
01:09:25.762 --> 01:09:28.922
I can send you down for years.

1207
01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:30.928
Talk.

1208
01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:33.019
Know the Royal Bank of Belgium?

1209
01:09:33.062 --> 01:09:33.925
Go on!

1210
01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:36.928
The notebook in your box
is in my hands.

1211
01:09:38.362 --> 01:09:41.227
You drown in your fine pool?

1212
01:09:41.263 --> 01:09:43.525
- What do you want?
- Not much.

1213
01:09:43.562 --> 01:09:47.222
You have 10 minutes to get
on your yacht and go home.

1214
01:09:49.463 --> 01:09:53.191
Bingo! I just bought
a shack you'll like.

1215
01:10:18.333 --> 01:10:19.697
I love it!

1216
01:10:19.733 --> 01:10:22.097
I came here once
to see the Colombian

1217
01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:24.497
and I fell in love with the place.

1218
01:10:28.134 --> 01:10:30.157
He refused to sell.

1219
01:10:32.201 --> 01:10:34.167
C'mon, I'll show you paradise.

1220
01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:41.559
Check that out! Amazing!

1221
01:10:41.602 --> 01:10:43.068
Follow me.

1222
01:10:52.903 --> 01:10:55.369
What did I tell you? Paradise!

1223
01:11:07.871 --> 01:11:09.837
Fresh, natural produce, see?

1224
01:11:09.871 --> 01:11:13.134
Not like the flour
you get in the city.

1225
01:11:13.872 --> 01:11:17.327
You turned me on in the bank,
popping open those boxes.

1226
01:11:17.372 --> 01:11:19.929
Eugene, isn't this a bit sudden?

1227
01:11:19.972 --> 01:11:21.836
No time to lose, kid.

1228
01:11:21.873 --> 01:11:24.032
In our line of work,
you gotta act fast.

1229
01:11:24.073 --> 01:11:27.835
Any moment, we could both be dead.
Make the most of it.

1230
01:11:27.873 --> 01:11:30.135
- You're right, Eugene...
- Call me Fenimore.

1231
01:11:30.173 --> 01:11:34.401
Give me time
to look my best for you.

1232
01:11:34.473 --> 01:11:36.996
Great idea!

1233
01:11:37.074 --> 01:11:39.404
We'll have a candlelit dinner
overlooking the sea.

1234
01:11:39.441 --> 01:11:41.100
That would be perfect.

1235
01:11:43.241 --> 01:11:45.105
Be right back...

1236
01:11:45.142 --> 01:11:47.005
Fenimore.

1237
01:11:51.342 --> 01:11:54.502
Delta 1, get me out of here.
The heat's on.

1238
01:11:54.542 --> 01:11:56.303
How soon can you be here?

1239
01:11:56.342 --> 01:11:57.501
Hold on.

1240
01:11:57.542 --> 01:11:59.406
How long will it take to repair?

1241
01:11:59.443 --> 01:12:02.603
Son, you're looking at 2-3 days.

1242
01:12:02.643 --> 01:12:05.973
Delta 2, I'm sending
reinforcements.

1243
01:12:09.943 --> 01:12:10.966
What are you doing?

1244
01:12:11.044 --> 01:12:12.567
Calling up reinforcements.

1245
01:12:15.411 --> 01:12:18.173
We did it!
The Belgian's confessed.

1246
01:12:18.211 --> 01:12:21.268
- He confessed?
- Everything.

1247
01:12:21.311 --> 01:12:23.277
We couldn't stop him.

1248
01:12:23.311 --> 01:12:25.277
We also took the opportunity
to close some other cases.

1249
01:12:25.311 --> 01:12:28.573
He's going down so long,
he'll never know.

1250
01:12:28.612 --> 01:12:29.976
That's not the right Belgian.

1251
01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.069
How come?

1252
01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:32.772
He was a decoy.

1253
01:12:32.812 --> 01:12:34.073
The real one was still in the bank.

1254
01:12:34.112 --> 01:12:36.271
So where's the real Belgian now?

1255
01:12:36.312 --> 01:12:39.745
I tailed him to the Colombian's villa
outside Cannes.

1256
01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:43.041
Both of them together.
The arrest of the century!

1257
01:12:43.113 --> 01:12:45.739
Red alert!

1258
01:12:52.781 --> 01:12:54.145
You look sublime, darling.

1259
01:12:54.181 --> 01:12:56.739
And you...
White suits you.

1260
01:12:56.782 --> 01:13:01.044
You think so? I like white.

1261
01:13:01.082 --> 01:13:03.241
I like white a lot,
but I prefer champagne.

1262
01:13:08.382 --> 01:13:10.349
- Gunshots?
- Just the one so far.

1263
01:13:10.383 --> 01:13:13.213
Believe me, a gunshot
never goes out alone.

1264
01:13:13.283 --> 01:13:14.112
What are you doing?

1265
01:13:14.183 --> 01:13:16.706
Setting up a forward position.

1266
01:13:16.784 --> 01:13:18.306
You play best at the back.

1267
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:21.317
It's just to get an idea
of the topography.

1268
01:13:21.351 --> 01:13:24.010
Facilitate the special forces' entry.

1269
01:13:24.051 --> 01:13:25.813
Put that in your ear.

1270
01:13:25.851 --> 01:13:27.908
You'll know where I'm at.

1271
01:13:35.752 --> 01:13:37.718
This will end in pain.

1272
01:13:39.252 --> 01:13:40.912
To us!

1273
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:55.975
I can't climb the wall,
but there's a post.

1274
01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:59.277
And a branch leading straight in.

1275
01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.684
Amazing they didn't saw that off.

1276
01:14:02.721 --> 01:14:04.778
Shit! They did!

1277
01:14:07.822 --> 01:14:10.788
That's topography brought
to you by Emilien.

1278
01:14:10.822 --> 01:14:12.685
Let's dance.

1279
01:14:29.690 --> 01:14:31.349
What a couple we make!

1280
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:35.153
Fire and ice.
My guile, your professionalism.

1281
01:14:35.191 --> 01:14:37.657
Striking fear across the land.

1282
01:14:37.691 --> 01:14:41.851
I'd be your Clyde.
You'd be my Bonnie.

1283
01:14:42.291 --> 01:14:43.348
Are we dancing or kissing?

1284
01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:45.051
A bit of both?

1285
01:14:45.092 --> 01:14:47.650
Or I'll think you're a mole.

1286
01:14:54.293 --> 01:14:56.724
Did nobody teach you to knock?

1287
01:14:56.793 --> 01:15:00.624
Sorry, boss.
Look what fell out of the sky.

1288
01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.216
The little Marseille cop.

1289
01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:05.125
Inspector.
But you'll get me promotion.

1290
01:15:05.161 --> 01:15:07.627
Hands up!
You're under arrest.

1291
01:15:09.161 --> 01:15:10.821
You got balls,
coming here with your pop gun,

1292
01:15:10.861 --> 01:15:14.816
to arrest public enemy No. 1
the Flanders Strangler,

1293
01:15:14.861 --> 01:15:17.725
the Benelux Terror.

1294
01:15:18.861 --> 01:15:20.725
The house is surrounded!

1295
01:15:20.762 --> 01:15:21.318
Sure it is.

1296
01:15:21.362 --> 01:15:24.124
Reinforcements! An Armada!

1297
01:15:24.163 --> 01:15:25.992
Helicopters circling overhead!

1298
01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:29.291
Any minute now!

1299
01:15:30.063 --> 01:15:33.587
- Fine, we'll wait for them...
- You must be out of your mind!

1300
01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:35.994
and prepare a reception.

1301
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:40.892
You will pay for your impudence!

1302
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:41.794
I want him!

1303
01:15:41.831 --> 01:15:43.888
I love tussling with a cop.

1304
01:15:43.931 --> 01:15:45.192
I was on a roll.

1305
01:15:45.231 --> 01:15:48.197
He can be my engagement gift,
my pink flamingo.

1306
01:15:48.231 --> 01:15:51.789
No gift could give me greater happiness.

1307
01:15:52.732 --> 01:15:54.595
- Listen, miss!
- I'm married!

1308
01:15:54.632 --> 01:15:56.292
I've never hit a woman.

1309
01:15:56.331 --> 01:15:58.957
You should know, I did 8 years of judo.
Japanese winger.

1310
01:16:03.332 --> 01:16:05.162
Great!

1311
01:16:06.699 --> 01:16:10.063
If you insist, but I fight fair.

1312
01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.259
Keep your eyes open, then!

1313
01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.163
Don't worry about me!

1314
01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.564
I am worried about you!

1315
01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.362
Do I know you?

1316
01:16:20.401 --> 01:16:22.060
Think hard!

1317
01:16:23.902 --> 01:16:26.561
I don't know what it's called,
but ouch!

1318
01:16:26.601 --> 01:16:29.658
Hurry, guys,
before the topographer's topped.

1319
01:16:33.002 --> 01:16:35.127
You like my fiancée?

1320
01:16:35.202 --> 01:16:36.930
Not my type.

1321
01:16:38.769 --> 01:16:41.327
Maybe if I was blonde.

1322
01:16:41.969 --> 01:16:42.628
Petra?

1323
01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:43.930
I knew I knew her.

1324
01:16:43.969 --> 01:16:46.128
About time.

1325
01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:51.537
Here comes Gibert
and his big band!

1326
01:16:53.171 --> 01:16:55.831
Maybe if I try the gate...

1327
01:16:55.871 --> 01:16:58.530
Ring the bell while you're at it!

1328
01:16:58.571 --> 01:17:01.129
Surprise is the key ingredient here.

1329
01:17:01.172 --> 01:17:05.002
Our ingenious catapult system
helps us hop over the wall.

1330
01:17:06.572 --> 01:17:08.697
The Swedish corkscrew.

1331
01:17:09.372 --> 01:17:11.702
Time to finish him off!

1332
01:17:11.739 --> 01:17:13.501
The death blow!

1333
01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.597
I have a knife.
Take me hostage.

1334
01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.196
Come again?

1335
01:17:17.239 --> 01:17:18.796
Turn me round and take me.

1336
01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.999
In front of everybody?

1337
01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.699
Take me hostage.

1338
01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:24.297
All right.

1339
01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:27.097
He's got a knife!

1340
01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.197
Where'd he get that?

1341
01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:29.900
I searched him personally.

1342
01:17:29.941 --> 01:17:31.497
Nobody move or she gets it!

1343
01:17:31.541 --> 01:17:32.598
Nobody move.

1344
01:17:32.641 --> 01:17:34.903
Don't worry, I'll handle this.

1345
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:36.498
OK, cop,

1346
01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:38.770
tell me what you want
and you'll have it.

1347
01:17:40.742 --> 01:17:44.072
Sure this is a good idea?
With no warm-up?

1348
01:17:44.509 --> 01:17:46.668
I am warm. I'm sizzling.

1349
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:51.471
You're talking to a finalist,
Saumur Trampoline Championship, 1971.

1350
01:17:51.509 --> 01:17:53.271
That was long ago!

1351
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:55.776
It's like riding a bike.
You never forget.

1352
01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:57.470
Crank it up!

1353
01:18:10.511 --> 01:18:11.738
Betrayed by technology!

1354
01:18:11.812 --> 01:18:13.744
Check out what's wrong.

1355
01:18:13.812 --> 01:18:15.438
Right away, chief.

1356
01:18:18.779 --> 01:18:20.142
What number are you?

1357
01:18:20.179 --> 01:18:21.736
How do I know!

1358
01:18:21.779 --> 01:18:25.439
I'm last in line.

1359
01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.239
The fuse must have blown.

1360
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.940
Trying to lift fatso.

1361
01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:32.536
Got it, chief!

1362
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:01.516
We have visitors.

1363
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:03.607
What do we do?

1364
01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:06.007
We go to war!

1365
01:19:12.851 --> 01:19:14.714
Wanna play do ya?

1366
01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:17.377
Wanna roast me?
So, come and get me!

1367
01:19:27.219 --> 01:19:29.481
Glad I stayed in the cab.

1368
01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:37.378
I'm No. 1 here! Got that?

1369
01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:39.181
Not just in Belgium.
The world's public enemy No. 1!

1370
01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:41.880
A few gendarmes don't scare me!

1371
01:20:03.589 --> 01:20:05.646
I'll blow you up a storm.
Just watch.

1372
01:20:07.489 --> 01:20:10.547
The gendarme counter-attacks!
You're bustin' my balls!

1373
01:20:11.989 --> 01:20:13.546
And this gendarme...

1374
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:16.948
is gonna clean up this town

1375
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:19.047
double-quick!

1376
01:20:37.358 --> 01:20:38.722
Daniel, help!

1377
01:20:38.759 --> 01:20:40.622
Ain't that a surprise.

1378
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:46.519
Who's the No. 1 now?

1379
01:20:58.561 --> 01:21:01.891
That's dangerous.
Time for some serious weaponry.

1380
01:21:02.562 --> 01:21:04.289
- He's crazy!
- What's he doing?

1381
01:21:04.328 --> 01:21:06.590
Look what I found!

1382
01:21:07.728 --> 01:21:09.785
I only ever saw this in photos.

1383
01:21:09.829 --> 01:21:10.692
Switch on.

1384
01:21:10.728 --> 01:21:12.887
He needs locking up!

1385
01:21:13.429 --> 01:21:16.884
I'm gonna waste those scumbags.

1386
01:21:40.099 --> 01:21:41.655
Help!

1387
01:22:05.401 --> 01:22:08.026
It's better in yellow.

1388
01:22:14.368 --> 01:22:15.833
My love!

1389
01:22:15.868 --> 01:22:19.232
To think I didn't recognize you.
I nearly hit you.

1390
01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:22.530
Don't worry, I'd have fought back.

1391
01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:29.832
Get a room, will you?

1392
01:22:38.671 --> 01:22:41.603
You're driving me to distraction.

1393
01:22:41.671 --> 01:22:44.694
I know. You're not the only one.

1394
01:22:48.438 --> 01:22:51.199
Take me to your leader.

1395
01:22:51.238 --> 01:22:52.704
Excuse me.

1396
01:22:53.339 --> 01:22:54.998
Hi, nice meet to you.

1397
01:22:56.339 --> 01:22:58.601
- Can I ask your rank?
- Commander.

1398
01:22:58.639 --> 01:22:59.605
Is that all?

1399
01:22:59.639 --> 01:23:02.605
You look like General material to me.

1400
01:23:02.639 --> 01:23:05.605
Somebody upstairs doesn't like you.

1401
01:23:05.639 --> 01:23:07.299
Leave it to me.

1402
01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:10.773
I know the top brass.

1403
01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:13.773
I give them a lot of business,
so they owe me favor or two.

1404
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:15.864
Let's talk it over in my car.

1405
01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:17.873
With pleasure.

1406
01:23:18.007 --> 01:23:19.667
Take him away!

1407
01:23:19.708 --> 01:23:22.970
You're making a mistake!
You'll pay for this!

1408
01:23:23.008 --> 01:23:26.168
Let go of me!

1409
01:23:32.509 --> 01:23:34.873
You steered us through a minefield.

1410
01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.170
Thanks,

1411
01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:38.869
but Emilien did all the work.
I just drove.

1412
01:23:38.909 --> 01:23:41.671
Actually, the meter's still ticking over.

1413
01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:44.540
I don't get it.
You knew he planned a heist?

1414
01:23:44.610 --> 01:23:48.736
Yes, and legally
we can't go near those boxes,

1415
01:23:48.810 --> 01:23:51.743
so we let him do it for us.

1416
01:23:51.778 --> 01:23:54.335
Seeing as he's going down anyway.

1417
01:23:54.377 --> 01:23:55.843
Exactly.

1418
01:23:55.878 --> 01:23:57.844
How did you know he'd escape?

1419
01:23:57.878 --> 01:24:01.333
The odds seemed pretty good.

1420
01:24:01.378 --> 01:24:02.935
Oh, yeah?

1421
01:24:03.679 --> 01:24:06.339
So I helped make
the operation a success?

1422
01:24:06.378 --> 01:24:08.640
You were just perfect.

1423
01:24:14.179 --> 01:24:16.441
Any news of Gibert?

1424
01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.708
We gave him a bottle of downers
and he just laughed.

1425
01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:23.907
C'mon, lads! We'll mash 'em!

1426
01:24:25.948 --> 01:24:27.607
Nice and easy,
take them to pieces!

1427
01:24:27.647 --> 01:24:29.511
He's still flying, huh?

1428
01:24:29.548 --> 01:24:31.707
We've tried everything.

1429
01:24:31.748 --> 01:24:34.714
He's down to run a marathon.
It won't be enough.

1430
01:24:34.748 --> 01:24:38.612
Footwork! Shoot!

1431
01:24:38.648 --> 01:24:40.910
Where'd they get these no-hopers?

1432
01:24:40.949 --> 01:24:43.814
Look at you!
It's The March of the Penguins!

1433
01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:50.775
Shoot!

1434
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:57.676
This isn't a knitting circle!
Give the ball hell!

1435
01:24:57.717 --> 01:24:59.478
Look!

1436
01:25:06.118 --> 01:25:11.381
That's not hard, is it?

1437
01:25:12.219 --> 01:25:15.185
Bring it under control and...

1438
01:25:15.219 --> 01:25:19.084
Round and Round!
Now, overhead kick!

1439
01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.052
Goal in! Goal In!
