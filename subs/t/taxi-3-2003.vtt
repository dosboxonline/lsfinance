00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.028
Keep dreamin', brother!

2
00:03:42.707 --> 00:03:43.833
Are you free?

3
00:03:43.874 --> 00:03:47.251
Mylord's offer is tempting,
alas, my heart is taken...

4
00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.377
But maybe I can amend that?

5
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.046
Aaah... mylord is
targetting my feelings!

6
00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:54.964
Who must I kill, at this rate?

7
00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:58.216
Nobody, but I must get to the airport.
You think it's possible in 20 minutes?

8
00:03:58.507 --> 00:04:01.426
20 minutes? Leaves me enough time
to finish my sandwich... get on board!

9
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:10.263
It's a perfect opportunity to test out
some new settings...

10
00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:11.223
let me know what you think!

11
00:04:44.157 --> 00:04:45.950
Do you mind if I put some music on?

12
00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:47.784
No... but get moving!

13
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.870
And there we go...!

14
00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:08.045
Mylord is lucky, the streets of
Marseille are empty in winter...

15
00:05:08.087 --> 00:05:09.796
it's more practical for sightseeing!

16
00:05:09.838 --> 00:05:11.131
Yeah, lucky me...

17
00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:21.261
But all this visiting is
gonna make us late...

18
00:05:21.302 --> 00:05:24.179
fasten your seatbelt please,
I'm gonna have to switch to 3rd gear...

19
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:25.222
No problem!

20
00:05:48.026 --> 00:05:49.068
You got some change?

21
00:05:49.318 --> 00:05:50.443
Well, no...

22
00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:51.278
Me neither...!

23
00:05:54.863 --> 00:05:57.072
Wasn't that Daniel?

24
00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.782
Who else 'd you think?
The Air Force?

25
00:05:58.823 --> 00:06:02.534
Looks like he's in good shape!
The cops won't catch him anytime soon!

26
00:06:02.575 --> 00:06:06.702
I wouldn't be so sure...
Apparently, the cops have a new weapon!

27
00:06:06.744 --> 00:06:09.829
A new weapon? What kind of weapon?

28
00:06:09.871 --> 00:06:11.705
A secret one.

29
00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:14.416
"State Police"

30
00:06:19.627 --> 00:06:20.877
This is boring...

31
00:06:28.298 --> 00:06:30.465
Oh shit! 298 km/h!

32
00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:34.427
Attention!
White cab driving at 298 km/h...

33
00:06:34.468 --> 00:06:36.553
l repeat: 298 km/h!

34
00:06:36.594 --> 00:06:38.179
Roger, we're on it!

35
00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:53.812
l was worried there,
l thought they were asleep!

36
00:06:53.853 --> 00:06:55.021
But that's a cop car!

37
00:06:55.063 --> 00:06:56.647
Oh no, just some old pals...

38
00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:58.815
They're very playful, you know!

39
00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:00.941
Bertrand, get his number
as soon as we're close enough!

40
00:07:00.982 --> 00:07:01.733
Don't worry...

41
00:07:07.486 --> 00:07:08.361
"Go Marseille!"

42
00:07:08.403 --> 00:07:11.197
Hey that's not a plate number!
It's an email!

43
00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:20.785
Ok, game's over.
Hang on!

44
00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:28.790
Hey, why are you stopping?

45
00:07:28.832 --> 00:07:30.708
Are you kidding?
I'm pedal to the metal!

46
00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:33.625
Is that nitro?

47
00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:35.960
Oh no, a friend of mine has a bar...

48
00:07:36.127 --> 00:07:37.794
it's made with Pastis.

49
00:07:38.128 --> 00:07:40.879
If you want, I can give you the address...

50
00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:42.255
You're very kind!

51
00:07:57.555 --> 00:08:00.682
Hold on a second... is that a TGV?

52
00:08:00.724 --> 00:08:02.141
Yeah, it's a good machine...

53
00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:06.560
it's fast in the curves...
but kinda slow in a straight line!

54
00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:09.270
Mamma mia!

55
00:08:15.023 --> 00:08:16.066
Where do I drop you off?

56
00:08:16.108 --> 00:08:17.816
Here!
Right here.

57
00:08:20.485 --> 00:08:22.194
19 minutes 32 seconds!

58
00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:28.114
I'm impressed!
No customer ever managed that...

59
00:08:28.155 --> 00:08:31.157
usually whenever I stop, hop!
...straight in the bag!

60
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:32.282
Thanks!

61
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.078
You're sure it's the right place?

62
00:08:39.203 --> 00:08:40.496
Absolutely.

63
00:08:45.665 --> 00:08:47.833
Oh, I see...

64
00:08:49.501 --> 00:08:51.793
Well thank you for your cooperation...

65
00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:57.588
Tell me, don't I know you from somewhere...?

66
00:08:57.671 --> 00:09:00.340
If I'd ever met you, I'd remember that!

67
00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:02.341
Bon voyage!

68
00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:09.720
Emilien's never gonna believe me!

69

Subtitles by Smarties

70
00:11:15.956 --> 00:11:17.290
What's wrong?

71
00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:22.293
Nothing. l had a nightmare.
Go back to sleep, darling.

72
00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:48.474
What the hell are you doing?

73
00:11:48.515 --> 00:11:51.059
Nothing! It's only been 8 months
that I can't sleep!

74
00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:52.852
Because of that gang?

75
00:11:53.102 --> 00:11:57.604
They've been bugging us for 8 months.
8 months! I can't get them off my mind!

76
00:11:57.645 --> 00:12:01.607
I noticed that! I've been trying
to tell you something for 8 months!

77
00:12:01.648 --> 00:12:04.566
I know, I know... We just can't
get them, no matter how we try!

78
00:12:04.608 --> 00:12:06.025
Did you hear what I said?

79
00:12:06.067 --> 00:12:06.692
Of course!

80
00:12:06.734 --> 00:12:08.944
And I'm glad you mention it,
because 37 hold ups in 8 months...

81
00:12:08.986 --> 00:12:10.652
all dressed up as Santa Claus,
can you imagine that?

82
00:12:10.737 --> 00:12:12.863
And you don't believe in
Santa anymore, right?

83
00:12:12.904 --> 00:12:14.780
I do! I mean, no,
it's not the problem...

84
00:12:14.822 --> 00:12:17.573
Now winter's here and I worry about the
Christmas present they may be preparing!

85
00:12:17.615 --> 00:12:20.117
Speaking of which, I already know
what I'm getting you for Christmas...

86
00:12:21.618 --> 00:12:26.078
Thanks Petra but you can't help me.
I must catch that gang by Christmas!

87
00:12:26.245 --> 00:12:29.288
And me Émilien, l need to talk
to you BEFORE Christmas!

88
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.289
Ok, that's a deal.

89
00:12:32.582 --> 00:12:33.582
What are you doing?

90
00:12:33.957 --> 00:12:35.125
l'm going to the office.

91
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.751
But it's 3 AM!

92
00:12:36.834 --> 00:12:43.713
What? Oh yeah... That's ok.
l'll avoid rush hour traffic.

93
00:12:43.755 --> 00:12:45.213
There won't be any traffic for sure!

94
00:12:45.256 --> 00:12:46.089
Good!

95
00:12:51.134 --> 00:12:52.551
See you in the office?

96
00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:39.451
Hello, I'd like to
make an appointment!

97
00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:41.995
Oh - Lily, honey!
You up already!

98
00:13:42.037 --> 00:13:44.704
Yes! I'm awake at 4 AM,
because my man is fixing his car!

99
00:13:44.746 --> 00:13:47.206
But it ain't broken!
lt's winter time.

100
00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:50.707
l am just making some modifications
to make it more stable in the cold...

101
00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:54.877
Listen, could you also install a heater
in my bed when you got time?

102
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.212
It would make me a bit more stable
too, since I'm ALONE in a cold bed!

103
00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.922
Except that it's not just in
winter time but all year round!

104
00:14:00.963 --> 00:14:01.964
Don't say that, Lily...

105
00:14:02.006 --> 00:14:06.341
Don't touch me! It'll take me forever
to remove the stains with a scrungie!

106
00:14:06.675 --> 00:14:08.217
Uh... what's a scrungie?

107
00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:13.220
A scrungie is used to clean out jugs,
pans and stupid pots - like me!

108
00:14:13.262 --> 00:14:15.221
Don't say that! Let me wash my hands,
I'll be with you in a minute.

109
00:14:15.263 --> 00:14:18.015
Oh no no no dear sir,
that's not how it works!

110
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.975
You wash your hands, then wait an hour
for that "white spirit" stench to vanish

111
00:14:22.017 --> 00:14:24.268
and by then, usually
it's time to go to work!

112
00:14:25.352 --> 00:14:26.936
Gee you're really up and running today!

113
00:14:26.977 --> 00:14:29.938
Look, I woke up two hours ago,
watched you in your sleep for 30 min,

114
00:14:29.979 --> 00:14:32.606
and since I couldn't sleep,
I decided to do something useful

115
00:14:32.648 --> 00:14:34.482
instead of just watching TV!

116
00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:36.567
Daniel! We don't HAVE a TV!

117
00:14:37.817 --> 00:14:39.484
Never mind, it's the
principle that counts!

118
00:14:39.526 --> 00:14:41.152
There's no TV, no stereo

119
00:14:41.194 --> 00:14:44.487
no curtains, no couch, not a single
vase to put some flowers in...

120
00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:46.572
assuming you'd ever offer me flowers...

121
00:14:46.697 --> 00:14:50.532
But we DO have a fridge. It's filled
with motor oil, but we have a fridge!

122
00:14:51.033 --> 00:14:51.533
Lily...

123
00:14:51.575 --> 00:14:53.451
We also have a shower
that smells of gas...

124
00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:55.535
a washer, specially designed
to wash car covers...

125
00:14:55.577 --> 00:14:58.245
a wardrobe, in which
my dresses must fight

126
00:14:58.287 --> 00:15:00.163
for room with host of tires...
- Lily!

127
00:15:00.246 --> 00:15:06.874
And finally, a glorious symbol of our
luxurious life, we also own... a garage!

128
00:15:06.916 --> 00:15:08.625
Hey what's wrong with you?
You're getting your period?

129
00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:10.543
No I'm not, that's the whole point!

130
00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:13.337
l just can't live anymore in a garage!

131
00:15:13.378 --> 00:15:15.129
l am a women.
Do you remember what that is?

132
00:15:15.254 --> 00:15:17.630
A woman is not just a smile
and a peachy soft skin.

133
00:15:18.048 --> 00:15:23.133
A women moves, thinks, evolves, and
sometimes would like some comfort!

134
00:15:25.802 --> 00:15:28.511
Oh dear... all this just because
I like to tinker with my car!

135
00:15:28.553 --> 00:15:29.804
That's women for you...!

136
00:15:35.599 --> 00:15:37.808
What's all that fuss about,
white spirit smells good!

137
00:15:46.188 --> 00:15:47.439
Lily, what are you doing?

138
00:15:48.856 --> 00:15:50.232
I'm going back to live with my parents.

139
00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:52.024
What, you're trading a garage
for an army barracks?

140
00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:55.151
Barracks with curtains, a small
garden and flowers on the table!

141
00:15:55.193 --> 00:15:57.152
Lily, this is ridiculous.
You can't leave me like that!

142
00:15:57.194 --> 00:15:58.987
You thought it was funny to
live in here with me!

143
00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:02.030
Yes, but it's not funny anymore and
I've been trying to tell you for months!

144
00:16:02.072 --> 00:16:04.323
First of all you don't live with ME,
you live with your CAR!

145
00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:05.782
This garage is too small
for both of us!

146
00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:08.783
It's your car or me. Good bye!

147
00:16:56.894 --> 00:17:00.104
Hi there, girls!
Getting the puppies some fresh air?

148
00:17:01.813 --> 00:17:05.231
Hey, take it easy!
What's a little joke between friends...

149
00:17:06.815 --> 00:17:08.608
Well then... Merry Christmas!

150
00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:17.946
But...? What are you doing...?

151
00:17:19.822 --> 00:17:21.698
Did you sleep in here?

152
00:17:21.783 --> 00:17:23.324
No, l was just dozing for five minutes...

153
00:17:24.325 --> 00:17:28.202
Must've been 5 long minutes then,
the folder is stamped on your face!

154
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:30.620
See, it's the same with trees...

155
00:17:30.662 --> 00:17:32.705
You know, tree stumps?
One circle equals one year?

156
00:17:32.747 --> 00:17:36.040
Well see, I can tell you've
been sleeping for...

157
00:17:38.041 --> 00:17:39.042
...20 years.

158
00:17:43.586 --> 00:17:45.837
Oh, forget it.
Just forget what I said, ok?

159
00:17:46.504 --> 00:17:48.797
Apparently nobody likes jokes
anymore around here...

160
00:17:48.963 --> 00:17:51.257
To think that I signed up because
I thought we'd have some fun...

161
00:17:51.299 --> 00:17:53.341
Stop it or I'm gonna split
your side... with an axe!

162
00:17:53.466 --> 00:17:56.468
Hey guys! I just got some fresh
weed here, want some?

163
00:17:57.093 --> 00:18:01.012
Oh, no, no...
NO! No no no...!

164
00:18:01.054 --> 00:18:02.930
Don't be stupid guys, it's high quality!
Straight from Jamaica!

165
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:08.891
Gosh really, from Jamaic...?
... no! Who'd you think we are?

166
00:18:09.059 --> 00:18:11.476
OK then - your loss.
Bye!

167
00:18:11.685 --> 00:18:12.185
Bye...

168
00:18:12.936 --> 00:18:13.561
Tell me...

169
00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:15.437
Hey!
What about some coke?

170
00:18:16.688 --> 00:18:17.313
Rashid...!

171
00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:18.772
Well then, good day to you...

172
00:18:20.315 --> 00:18:21.899
What's that supposed to mean?

173
00:18:23.482 --> 00:18:25.233
And what are all these posters on the wall?

174
00:18:25.317 --> 00:18:26.443
Uh... Bob Marley?

175
00:18:26.526 --> 00:18:28.235
Damnit, this is a police
station, not a squat!

176
00:18:28.277 --> 00:18:31.904
Are you aware that we've been trying
to catch a gang for the past 8 months?

177
00:18:32.738 --> 00:18:33.572
The Santa Claus gang?

178
00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:34.906
Yes, the Santa Claus gang!

179
00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.532
Glad you remembered
the name, at least!

180
00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:41.284
37 robberies in 8 months,
and no clue, nothing!

181
00:18:42.202 --> 00:18:44.411
I've searched everywhere...
and nothing, nothing at all.

182
00:18:45.912 --> 00:18:48.496
I feel useless.
A loser.

183
00:18:51.957 --> 00:18:56.292
How about if I... if I ask
Rashid for a little, uh, tonic?

184
00:18:56.335 --> 00:18:57.543
No.

185
00:18:57.835 --> 00:18:59.502
I'm just trying to help here...

186
00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:04.005
How about a little breakfast then?

187
00:19:05.881 --> 00:19:08.174
Just to get some energy back?

188
00:19:10.342 --> 00:19:11.718
OK, let's go have breakfast.

189
00:19:28.685 --> 00:19:31.437
Guess you were a little hungry, eh?

190
00:19:31.479 --> 00:19:33.896
I haven't eaten for days, out of
worrying over this case!

191
00:19:34.438 --> 00:19:35.564
l have these terrible nightmares.

192
00:19:35.606 --> 00:19:37.982
I'm strapped to a chair and a dozen
Santas dance around me...

193
00:19:38.023 --> 00:19:39.024
It's horrible!

194
00:19:39.066 --> 00:19:41.192
Stop it. Stop it, it's horrible!

195
00:19:41.734 --> 00:19:42.985
Your shoe's untied.

196
00:19:43.986 --> 00:19:47.946
Plus it'll be Christmas soon,
they'll be able to hide much better!

197
00:19:47.988 --> 00:19:50.364
That's right! It was easier in July!

198
00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:52.281
Yeah but we didn't catch 'em then...

199
00:19:52.323 --> 00:19:54.658
And now Christmas is coming,
and I know they're up to something.

200
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.534
Something big, to finish
the year with a bang.

201
00:19:56.743 --> 00:20:01.954
There's one thing that's puzzling me:
why do they dress up as Santa Claus?

202
00:20:02.037 --> 00:20:03.747
Nobody would suspect a Santa!
Look over there...

203
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:09.040
Santa is nice, he gives presents,
looks dorky in his big red outfit...

204
00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:12.042
It's usually too big...

205
00:20:16.462 --> 00:20:17.712
Or too small...

206
00:20:21.506 --> 00:20:23.007
It's a perfect disguise...

207
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:26.134
to hide...

208
00:20:28.551 --> 00:20:29.594
a gun!

209
00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:46.353
I can see that you are interested
in our new food processor

210
00:20:46.436 --> 00:20:48.021
it can chop, slice and grind!

211
00:20:48.646 --> 00:20:50.105
Do you have kids?

212
00:21:06.989 --> 00:21:09.699
You there, freeze!
Police!

213
00:21:14.577 --> 00:21:16.662
Don't move!
You are under arrest!

214
00:21:18.996 --> 00:21:20.039
What happened?

215
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.040
I got one, Alain!
It took me 8 months, but I got one!

216
00:21:23.373 --> 00:21:26.375
But how did you know he was a fake,
I mean, a member of the gang?

217
00:21:26.417 --> 00:21:28.876
Have you ever seen a Santa
carry a peacemaker?

218
00:21:28.918 --> 00:21:30.419
A gun! How'd you know?

219
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.878
This dork dropped it!

220
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.837
What a dork!

221
00:21:32.962 --> 00:21:34.171
Yep, dorky for sure.

222
00:21:34.212 --> 00:21:34.755
You're a dork!

223
00:21:34.963 --> 00:21:36.756
The inspector's gonna like this!
Let's go!

224
00:21:37.006 --> 00:21:41.341
Hello boss! Look what I got here!
Shit, where is he when you need him?

225
00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:43.677
You, put your ass down
there and don't move, ok?

226
00:21:45.594 --> 00:21:49.012
Well, until the Chief gets here,
let's just pretend I'm the Chief, ok?

227
00:21:49.888 --> 00:21:51.306
I think that desk fits me, what d'you think?

228
00:21:51.889 --> 00:21:52.973
Hey, you're sure about this?

229
00:21:53.015 --> 00:21:55.058
Bof, he's gone anyway...
And after this catch,

230
00:21:55.099 --> 00:21:57.225
I'm sure we won't remain simple
inspectors much longer, trust me!

231
00:21:57.434 --> 00:22:00.936
Ok Santa, in the meantime you're gonna
tell us how you got a cop's gun...

232
00:22:00.977 --> 00:22:02.228
Who did you steal it from?

233
00:22:04.313 --> 00:22:06.189
Alain, I think that Santa
is looking for an address...

234
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.481
The Marseille region?

235
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.654
Whenever you forget something,
my colleague will use the directory.

236
00:22:18.696 --> 00:22:19.446
You got that?

237
00:22:19.487 --> 00:22:22.573
Now about this gun... you know,
there is a registration number here...

238
00:22:22.614 --> 00:22:24.407
All we have to do is
search the database,

239
00:22:24.449 --> 00:22:25.991
and in a few seconds we'll know

240
00:22:26.033 --> 00:22:28.117
which idiot got his weapon mugged!

241
00:22:31.744 --> 00:22:34.537
What a dork!
He stole Gibert's gun!

242
00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:38.707
- lmpossible!
- l swear. Take a look!

243
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.291
Did you know that you stole this
from our favorite commissioner?

244
00:22:41.959 --> 00:22:44.126
Can you explain how
you pulled that off?

245
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.711
Alain...

246
00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:48.712
Maybe it would be easier
if we removed the sticky tape...?

247
00:22:49.963 --> 00:22:51.630
You're right.
That might help.

248
00:22:57.467 --> 00:22:58.468
Émilien?

249
00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.261
Co... commissioner!

250
00:23:04.762 --> 00:23:06.013
I'm needed out there...

251
00:23:09.014 --> 00:23:11.058
But why are you dressed up
like that, Commissioner?

252
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.102
l am doing my job, Émilien. I tried
to infiltrate the Santa Claus gang...

253
00:23:15.143 --> 00:23:17.478
but you had to screw up
everything, as usual!

254
00:23:18.103 --> 00:23:20.063
I'm... I'm sorry, Chief, but...!

255
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.897
Why didn't you inform us,
we would all have joined you!

256
00:23:22.939 --> 00:23:24.982
It's not an invasion,
It's an infiltration...

257
00:23:25.023 --> 00:23:27.066
Precise, meticulous
and SOLITARY!

258
00:23:27.149 --> 00:23:30.485
But don't worry Émilien, I'll get
a tailored costume for you.

259
00:23:30.526 --> 00:23:33.945
It includes a cap and a whistle,
so you can infiltrate every crossroad!

260
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:37.072
And now would you please
unfasten me, so I can kill you?

261
00:23:37.114 --> 00:23:38.281
Of course, Chief.

262
00:23:38.406 --> 00:23:40.991
Shit...
Alain took the key with him!

263
00:23:41.032 --> 00:23:42.950
Hurry up Émilien,
I'm losing patience!

264
00:23:42.992 --> 00:23:43.951
5 minutes, Chief.

265
00:23:53.081 --> 00:23:54.581
Are you Commissioner Gibert?

266
00:23:55.832 --> 00:23:57.041
No, not yet...

267
00:23:57.083 --> 00:24:01.877
I mean, I'm not commissioner yet and
I'm not called Gibert... unfortunately.

268
00:24:02.044 --> 00:24:04.587
I mean, I sure wouldn't want
to be called Gibert, but...

269
00:24:04.629 --> 00:24:05.504
The key, Émilien...!

270
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.588
Right away, Chief!

271
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:16.886
Are you commissioner Gibert?

272
00:24:18.803 --> 00:24:22.055
Yes I am... wha wha...
wow... what can I help you?

273
00:24:23.097 --> 00:24:24.806
Good afternoon.
My name is Qiu.

274
00:24:25.056 --> 00:24:28.100
Qiu? Coo, how cute! I would queue
for your coo...chie.. uh?

275
00:24:28.142 --> 00:24:30.851
I mean, that's a really
cute name, "Qiu"...

276
00:24:31.644 --> 00:24:32.936
That name from China?

277
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.022
Yes. My mother is chinese,
and my father... swiss.

278
00:24:37.105 --> 00:24:40.023
Aah, l know the place well...
Switzerland, that is.

279
00:24:40.607 --> 00:24:44.276
l am a journalist from
World lnternational.

280
00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:47.486
I am currently working on a big
report about the French police.

281
00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:52.363
l want to follow closely the work of a big
inspector, and l heard you are the biggest.

282
00:24:52.613 --> 00:24:57.949
Err, yeah that's right... 6' 4" and 220 lb,
that's pretty big for the police...

283
00:24:58.074 --> 00:25:00.160
How impressive.

284
00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:04.412
Oh? Yes, sure! When I look in the mirror
I often impress myself, me personally...

285
00:25:05.162 --> 00:25:08.372
May I get "embedded"
with you for a few days?

286
00:25:08.455 --> 00:25:10.456
As often and as long
as you want...!

287
00:25:10.498 --> 00:25:12.958
Err, l mean, as long as needed
to conduct your probe.

288
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.084
I like to be in bed too when
I probe err... embedded...

289
00:25:16.502 --> 00:25:18.795
Thank you very much.
Do we start now?

290
00:25:19.295 --> 00:25:20.712
With pleasure...

291
00:25:27.925 --> 00:25:29.842
- Thank you, coochie...!
- You're welcome.

292
00:25:33.761 --> 00:25:37.263
What are you doing, dressed
up as Santa in your office?

293
00:25:37.305 --> 00:25:41.307
Eh? This!
This is a camouflage.

294
00:25:41.348 --> 00:25:45.350
We are trying to catch a gang, whose
members disguise as Santa Claus.

295
00:25:45.392 --> 00:25:49.186
So we have to merge with their universe
in order to penetrate them better...

296
00:25:49.312 --> 00:25:50.562
And the handcuffs?

297
00:25:50.687 --> 00:25:52.354
I have no idea, they're not mine!

298
00:25:53.397 --> 00:25:54.981
So, any further questions?

299
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.566
Come in.

300
00:25:58.733 --> 00:25:59.442
Am I disturbing?

301
00:25:59.483 --> 00:26:01.734
Oh no, in my current state,
nothing can disturb me anymore...

302
00:26:02.277 --> 00:26:05.070
Well since you're alone in your
office and not doing any work,

303
00:26:05.111 --> 00:26:06.696
I'd like to talk with
you for 5 minutes.

304
00:26:06.737 --> 00:26:09.656
Petra, please, not now.
We'll discuss it at home tonight, ok?

305
00:26:09.698 --> 00:26:14.241
At home all think about is your work.
So I thought now that you're at work,

306
00:26:14.283 --> 00:26:15.701
...maybe we could discuss
something about our home!

307
00:26:15.742 --> 00:26:17.785
Not today Petra.
Just not today, ok?

308
00:26:17.827 --> 00:26:20.579
But you've been telling me
''not today'' for 8 months now!

309
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.831
Listen, l am in shit creek up to my neck
so please don't push me down - not you!

310
00:26:25.247 --> 00:26:27.373
What is it this time?

311
00:26:27.666 --> 00:26:30.834
l caught a Santa.
With a gun, can you imagine?

312
00:26:30.875 --> 00:26:32.168
So of course, l thought
he was from the gang!

313
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.878
You don't need to see a Santa
or a gun to think about it!

314
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.128
You're ALWAYS thinking
about that gang!

315
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:40.089
Yes, but this time there were both:
a Santa AND a gun, so I arrested him.

316
00:26:40.173 --> 00:26:41.756
You disarmed him by yourself?

317
00:26:42.132 --> 00:26:43.216
Well... yes?

318
00:26:43.257 --> 00:26:44.883
Guess he wasn't
from the gang, then.

319
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.427
Unfortunately not...
lt was Gibert, dressed up as Santa.

320
00:26:49.303 --> 00:26:51.011
Sure, just laugh at me.

321
00:26:51.053 --> 00:26:55.056
It's the worst day of my life, and you
are laughing instead of cheering me up!

322
00:26:55.098 --> 00:26:56.348
You'd like me to cheer you up?

323
00:26:56.389 --> 00:27:00.184
Why, yes... you could say something nice,
some tender, loving words...

324
00:27:00.309 --> 00:27:04.144
for example, tell me some good news.
Just for ONCE today, some GOOD news!

325
00:27:04.186 --> 00:27:06.770
Émilien! l am pregnant.

326
00:27:07.395 --> 00:27:08.063
No!

327
00:27:08.105 --> 00:27:10.522
Yes!
How's that for good news?

328
00:27:10.606 --> 00:27:13.649
Well yes, of course...
But how long have you been...?

329
00:27:13.691 --> 00:27:15.109
For 8 months, Émilien!

330
00:27:15.609 --> 00:27:17.401
- No!
- Yes!

331
00:27:18.026 --> 00:27:20.195
Oh... but how did it happen?

332
00:27:20.237 --> 00:27:22.613
I met the Holy Ghost,
8 months ago...

333
00:27:22.654 --> 00:27:27.115
8 months? It can't be! I was there,
I would have seen, your belly...

334
00:27:27.281 --> 00:27:28.657
And your breasts...

335
00:27:29.783 --> 00:27:33.035
Aah... so that's why they became so...!

336
00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:36.996
And you... you're gonna keep it?

337
00:27:37.037 --> 00:27:39.205
It's a bit too late
to ask that question!

338
00:27:39.288 --> 00:27:41.123
Well yes, but...
why didn't you tell me?

339
00:27:41.164 --> 00:27:43.624
I've been trying to
tell you for 8 months!

340
00:27:43.665 --> 00:27:47.209
I've placed cauliflowers in every room!
There... and there!

341
00:27:47.918 --> 00:27:50.753
Oh... yeah, l was wondering
about all those veggies!

342
00:27:50.794 --> 00:27:54.922
And I hung up at least 20 echographies.
They are everywhere!

343
00:28:07.345 --> 00:28:08.263
ls it my baby?

344
00:28:08.304 --> 00:28:09.514
Well for now it's mine.

345
00:28:09.555 --> 00:28:11.890
lf you want a share of it,
you'll better wake up!

346
00:28:14.391 --> 00:28:15.517
ls the baby normal?

347
00:28:15.558 --> 00:28:18.560
Good question, when you
know the father...

348
00:28:18.602 --> 00:28:20.978
but yes, amazingly,
everything is normal!

349
00:28:21.103 --> 00:28:24.647
But then... if you're pregnant
and everything is normal...

350
00:28:24.688 --> 00:28:29.065
and you want to keep the baby...
That means I will be a daddy?

351
00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:34.485
Yes! What a display of brainpower!
You should consider joining the police.

352
00:28:34.527 --> 00:28:35.861
l am going to be a daddy?

353
00:28:35.986 --> 00:28:39.738
Yes. And this child will need
a super-daddy.

354
00:28:41.239 --> 00:28:45.241
Count on me Petra,
Count on me...!

355
00:28:46.159 --> 00:28:47.200
Lily!

356
00:28:58.248 --> 00:28:59.916
What a fool you are.

357
00:29:00.207 --> 00:29:04.002
What good is your big car now, if you
can't put the woman you love in it?

358
00:29:09.129 --> 00:29:10.172
Rapid test?

359
00:29:11.173 --> 00:29:12.923
Rapid test for what?

360
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.717
Two bars...
What does that mean, two bars?

361
00:29:26.806 --> 00:29:27.431
Hello!

362
00:29:27.598 --> 00:29:27.890
Hello!

363
00:29:28.098 --> 00:29:29.766
Do you have the box
that comes with this?

364
00:29:30.266 --> 00:29:31.309
Let me see...

365
00:29:33.143 --> 00:29:36.519
"Clearblue rapid test".
Hey, isn't that a pregnancy test?

366
00:29:36.645 --> 00:29:38.813
Yes exactly, that's what
I'm anxious to find out!

367
00:29:38.854 --> 00:29:42.690
Aaah, I see... Let me fetch them,
they're right next to the condoms...

368
00:29:59.824 --> 00:30:01.241
Guess what, I'm out of them!

369
00:30:01.283 --> 00:30:05.160
They're in high demand these days.
Women love to make those presents...

370
00:30:05.202 --> 00:30:06.953
... a cute little baby for Christmas!

371
00:30:06.994 --> 00:30:09.162
See, I want to find out if
this is my Christmas present!

372
00:30:09.871 --> 00:30:13.290
Aaah, I see... Just a minute,
let me ask my daughter.

373
00:30:13.373 --> 00:30:14.373
Angel!

374
00:30:14.582 --> 00:30:18.501
She's studying pharmacy,
she knows all that stuff by heart.

375
00:30:18.543 --> 00:30:20.001
You'll see, it's really impressive!

376
00:30:20.126 --> 00:30:21.461
Angel, what's that?

377
00:30:23.337 --> 00:30:25.964
l am so sorry daddy!
I swear I tried to be careful!

378
00:30:26.339 --> 00:30:28.548
But I drank a little too much
and ran out of protections...

379
00:30:29.173 --> 00:30:32.258
But honey! There are condoms here,
I told you to just help yourself!

380
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.759
Yes, but we don't
have his size!

381
00:30:34.426 --> 00:30:35.010
Who did that to you?

382
00:30:35.177 --> 00:30:36.052
I have no idea!

383
00:30:36.094 --> 00:30:37.928
What do you mean, "no idea"!
Doesn't that guy have a name?

384
00:30:38.011 --> 00:30:41.055
l told you, l was drunk!
I can't remember all their names!

385
00:30:41.722 --> 00:30:43.014
Oh my God...!

386
00:30:43.473 --> 00:30:45.640
Oh come on... merry Christmas!

387
00:30:46.683 --> 00:30:47.642
"Where is the police?"

388
00:30:47.726 --> 00:30:49.184
Gentlemen, this is serious.

389
00:30:49.393 --> 00:30:52.311
All the attempts we made to
arrest the Santa Claus gang

390
00:30:52.353 --> 00:30:55.188
including a personal commando
operation carried out by myself

391
00:30:55.396 --> 00:30:57.939
have failed, part of them because
of a over-zealous Émilien...

392
00:30:58.565 --> 00:31:02.400
But nevermind, this is the past!
The future is ours! And we'll do...

393
00:31:02.442 --> 00:31:05.861
what we decided yesterday
to do tomorrow, starting today!

394
00:31:05.944 --> 00:31:07.903
You should write that down.
That's a good one...

395
00:31:07.945 --> 00:31:10.446
Maybe a little twisted,
but I think it sounds good...

396
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280
Émilien, your shoe's untied.

397
00:31:12.322 --> 00:31:13.781
Yeah, it's just great...

398
00:31:14.198 --> 00:31:16.074
That's good...
Ok... now, where was I?

399
00:31:16.116 --> 00:31:16.908
At "this is serious", Chief!

400
00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:18.367
Yes it IS serious!

401
00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:23.996
And l won't accept any inopportune
mistakes or nauseous deviations!

402
00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:25.246
Don't write that.

403
00:31:25.454 --> 00:31:29.499
I want everything to be perfect,
smooth, "clean"! "Super-clean"!

404
00:31:30.457 --> 00:31:33.251
You see, last summer l attended
a training seminar with the FBI...

405
00:31:33.292 --> 00:31:36.293
so you see, some of the language
stuck... it's a reflex.

406
00:31:36.335 --> 00:31:37.336
Crazy, eh?

407
00:31:38.587 --> 00:31:39.420
... eh?...

408
00:31:40.212 --> 00:31:42.922
So now I am giving you the "go"...

409
00:31:44.798 --> 00:31:49.009
Not having caught the Santa gang
before Christmas is not an option!

410
00:31:50.843 --> 00:31:54.220
Of course this means no
vacations, sick leaves...

411
00:31:54.262 --> 00:31:55.679
Not even an excuse letter
from your parents!

412
00:31:56.513 --> 00:32:01.599
Especially since miss Piu... Qiu,
journalist of the... magazine

413
00:32:01.641 --> 00:32:03.600
Is giving us the honor of
following us on this mission.

414
00:32:03.642 --> 00:32:07.144
So I hope she will return to her country
with a good opinion of our police!

415
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.854
The important words to
this mission are:

416
00:32:10.354 --> 00:32:13.814
Concentration, Reflection...
...Action!

417
00:32:14.606 --> 00:32:16.482
The codename for
this mission will be...

418
00:32:16.524 --> 00:32:20.693
Operation "Snow-white"

419
00:32:21.902 --> 00:32:23.819
Uh, that means
"Blanche-Neige" in French...

420
00:32:23.861 --> 00:32:25.487
And guess who'll
play the dwarves...

421
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.113
Yeah... it's awesome...!

422
00:32:27.155 --> 00:32:30.782
So from now on, I want each
and every one of you on alert 24/7!

423
00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:32.366
So is this clear?

424
00:32:33.159 --> 00:32:33.784
Questions?

425
00:32:33.825 --> 00:32:34.367
Me!

426
00:32:34.409 --> 00:32:34.742
You?

427
00:32:34.784 --> 00:32:35.243
Yes!

428
00:32:35.285 --> 00:32:35.701
Oh?

429
00:32:35.743 --> 00:32:36.994
What's that gift
on your desk, Chief?

430
00:32:37.036 --> 00:32:37.577
A gift?

431
00:32:38.244 --> 00:32:40.704
Ooh! That's very kind.
Is that for my birthday?

432
00:32:40.788 --> 00:32:41.996
Uh, when were
you born, Chief?

433
00:32:42.079 --> 00:32:42.747
In July!

434
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:43.664
Must be for Christmas, then.

435
00:32:43.705 --> 00:32:45.290
Whatever. It's the
intention that counts!

436
00:32:58.213 --> 00:33:00.089
Well there's something new...

437
00:33:00.715 --> 00:33:01.715
Very nice.
Who is it from?

438
00:33:01.757 --> 00:33:03.591
Must be someone
that knows you well!

439
00:33:04.967 --> 00:33:07.052
There's a little button on top...

440
00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:07.803
Yes...?

441
00:33:11.137 --> 00:33:12.388
Put the guns down!

442
00:33:13.181 --> 00:33:14.556
Aah, it's wonderful...

443
00:33:15.307 --> 00:33:19.100
Hey, you Pigs, this is Santa!
If you still believe in me, meet me

444
00:33:19.142 --> 00:33:23.227
at the European Bank for your gifts.
But hurry up, we leave at noon!

445
00:33:25.687 --> 00:33:27.063
Does anyone know
what time it is?

446
00:33:27.855 --> 00:33:29.440
IT'S 5 TO 12, CHIEF!

447
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:34.483
RED ALEEERT!

448
00:33:37.152 --> 00:33:41.112
I said "discreetly"! How am I
supposed to work with such jerks!

449
00:33:41.237 --> 00:33:44.281
Those assholes... no no,
don't write this down, miss Qiu.

450
00:33:44.323 --> 00:33:46.907
It's just a temporary reaction,
typical French - we fight sometimes

451
00:33:46.949 --> 00:33:48.575
... however, we still mean it!

452
00:33:50.367 --> 00:33:55.412
Gibert here. Deploy and await my signal.
Let us initiate... uh... well, let's go!

453
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:58.872
They will probably act like last time,
exit from the back in a fast car...

454
00:33:58.997 --> 00:34:00.915
All we have to do is wait.
We'll catch them by surprise.

455
00:34:00.998 --> 00:34:03.416
Chief... we won't surprise them
since THEY sent us the message?

456
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:07.460
Look, they sent us a message to fool us,
being certain we'd take it for a joke...

457
00:34:07.501 --> 00:34:09.294
But that's counting without me,
Commissioner Gibert!

458
00:34:09.377 --> 00:34:11.463
Commissioner Gibert is
not falling for their trap!

459
00:34:11.504 --> 00:34:13.672
He is here, on time,
ready to attack!

460
00:34:13.755 --> 00:34:17.632
I understand, Chief, but what if the
trap consisted in attracting us here?

461
00:34:17.674 --> 00:34:20.801
Come on, think Émilien, think!
It doesn't make sense,

462
00:34:20.843 --> 00:34:24.511
why would a gang alert the cops when
they are about to commit a crime?

463
00:34:24.553 --> 00:34:25.971
I know, I know, that's
what's worrying me...

464
00:34:26.012 --> 00:34:27.805
They haven't been acting stupidly
during the last eight months...

465
00:34:27.847 --> 00:34:30.806
There's a first time for everything! And
particulary for stupidities, trust me!

466
00:34:30.848 --> 00:34:31.682
Unless...

467
00:34:32.682 --> 00:34:33.891
Unless what?

468
00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:35.601
Unless they are certain
they'll manage to escape?

469
00:34:35.642 --> 00:34:39.311
Hahaha... just let them try!
There's no escaping me, believe me!

470
00:34:40.437 --> 00:34:41.104
Chief!

471
00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:41.687
Yes?

472
00:34:51.818 --> 00:34:54.527
They will have to pass over us
if they want to leave that bank!

473
00:34:58.363 --> 00:35:00.155
What's that thing, there?

474
00:35:03.282 --> 00:35:05.158
lt's... it's a nightmare!

475
00:35:28.463 --> 00:35:29.547
Are you ok, Chief?

476
00:35:29.631 --> 00:35:33.383
I'm fine, I'm fine! What are you
waiting for to start the pursuit?

477
00:35:33.424 --> 00:35:34.967
How are we supposed to
stop a machine like that?

478
00:35:35.009 --> 00:35:38.218
How should I know?
Show some initiative, damnit!

479
00:35:38.844 --> 00:35:40.595
Alain, requisition a car!

480
00:35:45.222 --> 00:35:47.223
That guy's got some nerve!
Why didn't he stop his car?

481
00:35:47.265 --> 00:35:49.767
For a black cop in Marseille?
Fat chance!

482
00:35:49.808 --> 00:35:52.559
Well yeah, but still... he could've
slowed down, at least!

483
00:35:53.477 --> 00:35:56.854
It's OK! It's OK.
I'm used to it.

484
00:35:57.396 --> 00:35:59.313
Chief, maybe we should requisition
one of our own cars!

485
00:35:59.355 --> 00:36:01.856
Good thinking, Émilien.
GET IN THE CARS!

486
00:36:01.898 --> 00:36:05.191
Now this is our new security system.
It's unique worldwide!

487
00:36:05.441 --> 00:36:08.360
It's based on the "ATLAS"
system used by the police.

488
00:36:08.443 --> 00:36:12.445
All you have to do is push this button
and the cops will get here ASAP.

489
00:36:19.199 --> 00:36:20.409
It's really efficient!

490
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:34.332
Oh shit oh shit!

491
00:36:48.632 --> 00:36:50.216
- Oh shit, my ride!
- Oh shit, my ride!

492
00:37:03.598 --> 00:37:05.849
Maybe I should get off here,
you would lose some weight!

493
00:37:05.892 --> 00:37:10.727
C'mon Émilien, your 50 lb won't make
a difference! And you, GO GO GO!

494
00:37:21.275 --> 00:37:23.359
So here we are in the famous
Marseille harbour...

495
00:37:23.443 --> 00:37:27.320
over there it's the "Cannelière",
taking it's name from cannabis...

496
00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:29.196
you know, to make ropes...

497
00:37:29.237 --> 00:37:32.531
it was built by King Louis XIV
in 1661 and... watch out!

498
00:37:33.282 --> 00:37:34.782
What the fuck...?
Are you keeping up, son?

499
00:37:34.824 --> 00:37:38.326
Certainly, sir! "...was built by
King Louis XIV in 1661"...

500
00:37:38.367 --> 00:37:40.869
You don't have to follow what
I'm SAYING, you moron!

501
00:37:40.911 --> 00:37:42.954
I'm talking about that big truck
with the big tires, there!

502
00:37:44.121 --> 00:37:44.788
Oh dear oh dear...

503
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:47.915
See, my little coochie,
the problem is the staff!

504
00:37:47.957 --> 00:37:50.041
They don't pay any attention
during recruiting!

505
00:37:50.083 --> 00:37:53.000
For example this lad would make
an excellent swimming instructor,

506
00:37:53.042 --> 00:37:57.212
but now he's in a car chase without
even having a driver's license!

507
00:37:57.295 --> 00:37:59.421
Wha... what's that?
You don't have your license?

508
00:37:59.504 --> 00:38:01.172
Well no, I only joined
the police yesterday!

509
00:38:01.214 --> 00:38:02.298
I don't believe this!

510
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.466
Calm down, Émilien. All he has to do
is follow that big truck over there...

511
00:38:05.507 --> 00:38:08.051
... piece of cake really, even a
swimming instructor could do it!

512
00:38:15.555 --> 00:38:16.263
What do I do now?

513
00:38:16.305 --> 00:38:18.181
You follow it, son,
just follow it!

514
00:38:21.725 --> 00:38:23.767
That truck must be drinking
a gallon of gas per mile!

515
00:38:23.809 --> 00:38:27.561
It'll run dry long before us!
I'd say in 5 or 10 minutes...

516
00:38:27.603 --> 00:38:29.605
That's supposing we're
still alive in 5 minutes!

517
00:38:29.646 --> 00:38:31.105
We will, we will...

518
00:39:03.164 --> 00:39:06.083
Maybe we should stop and
apologize to these people...

519
00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:09.001
There's a time for everything, Émilien.
Let's rush first, we'll apologize later...

520
00:39:09.042 --> 00:39:10.502
But we're rather
CRUSHING right now...!

521
00:39:10.543 --> 00:39:12.336
Stop your play on words,
Émilien! That's enough!

522
00:39:12.378 --> 00:39:13.169
Am I supposed to stop now?

523
00:39:13.212 --> 00:39:14.045
Huh? What for?

524
00:39:14.087 --> 00:39:14.670
There's a swimming pool!

525
00:39:14.712 --> 00:39:16.964
Yes, that might be a good...
STOP!

526
00:39:18.006 --> 00:39:20.508
Phew... that was
really close, eh?

527
00:39:21.924 --> 00:39:23.842
Hey! Watch it, there!

528
00:39:40.268 --> 00:39:42.019
I knew we wouldn't
last 5 minutes...

529
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.521
See? That's some good insulation,
that is. Not a single leak!

530
00:39:45.729 --> 00:39:48.606
Um... is this standard
procedure with the police?

531
00:39:48.648 --> 00:39:51.149
Absolutely not! ln most of
cases, the cars leak...

532
00:39:53.276 --> 00:39:55.902
Chief... I... I can't swim!

533
00:39:55.943 --> 00:39:58.653
Oh, don't worry, Alain! We have
a swimming instructor with us...

534
00:40:26.044 --> 00:40:28.545
Ah, my little Daniel!
What a pleasure to see you again.

535
00:40:29.086 --> 00:40:30.337
Oh dear, you don't
look too good...

536
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:33.005
I think you're spending too much
time with my daughter.

537
00:40:33.047 --> 00:40:37.008
Just kidding! At your age, it's
normal to have some fun...

538
00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.509
Have you seen my driver by any chance?
He's running late...

539
00:40:39.551 --> 00:40:42.218
l just saw him at the crossroad.
He'll be here in no time.

540
00:40:42.719 --> 00:40:43.553
Glad to hear it!

541
00:40:43.844 --> 00:40:45.345
Tell me, is Lily here
by any chance?

542
00:40:45.429 --> 00:40:47.221
Yes, she is.
LILY!

543
00:40:47.263 --> 00:40:49.097
I'm sorry darling,
I thought you were upstairs...

544
00:40:49.222 --> 00:40:50.973
It's ok, daddy,
I'm used to it...

545
00:40:51.558 --> 00:40:53.392
Look who is here...

546
00:40:53.434 --> 00:40:55.226
Good morning Lily.
Can we talk for a minute?

547
00:40:55.435 --> 00:40:58.686
Not now.
l have to go see my doctor...!

548
00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.395
Can you drop me off Daddy,
it's on your way...

549
00:41:00.437 --> 00:41:02.647
Sure, honey, if my driver
ever gets here...

550
00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.398
Now that you mention it,
I thought he had some trouble...

551
00:41:05.523 --> 00:41:07.649
Maybe I could drop you off...
both of you?

552
00:41:07.774 --> 00:41:08.692
Affirmative.

553
00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:12.444
It'll teach him to be late.
And now - all aboard!

554
00:41:16.947 --> 00:41:18.530
To the Boulevard Cassini, driver.

555
00:41:18.613 --> 00:41:19.739
Very well, Madam.

556
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.248
Tell me, you are late! Daniel
kindly offered to drive us,

557
00:41:36.332 --> 00:41:38.917
so I'll meet you back at the
barracks after my appointment.

558
00:41:48.547 --> 00:41:50.340
Tell me, didn't you use
to drive a bit faster?

559
00:41:50.423 --> 00:41:53.467
Who, me? Well, there's a lot of people
on the streets this time of year...

560
00:41:53.508 --> 00:41:56.634
and there's a lot of potholes,
so I can't drive very fast...!

561
00:41:56.676 --> 00:41:59.678
Besides, taking things nice and easy
from time to time can't hurt...

562
00:41:59.761 --> 00:42:02.262
Indeed, just so long as I'm not late...

563
00:42:05.056 --> 00:42:06.432
What? What's wrong?

564
00:42:06.474 --> 00:42:07.265
It hurts!

565
00:42:07.307 --> 00:42:08.516
Where, honey?
What's hurting?

566
00:42:08.558 --> 00:42:08.933
My belly...!

567
00:42:08.975 --> 00:42:12.352
Your belly? But that's terrible!
What are we going to do, General?

568
00:42:12.393 --> 00:42:14.769
I have no idea!
Does it hurt very badly, darling?

569
00:42:17.355 --> 00:42:18.688
Noo - o.
It's over now.

570
00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:19.689
It's over?

571
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:20.314
Yes, it's over.

572
00:42:20.522 --> 00:42:22.899
It's over!
It's over... it's over...

573
00:42:29.361 --> 00:42:32.446
Tell me Daniel, you're really a nervous
wreck today! What's wrong?

574
00:42:32.488 --> 00:42:36.240
lt's because Christmas is nearing...
All those presents... makes me nervous.

575
00:42:36.281 --> 00:42:39.575
l can see that... what's that
thing you got on your ear?

576
00:42:40.492 --> 00:42:45.203
Oh that...? Nothing, it's just
a new gadget: a stress-o-meter!

577
00:42:45.453 --> 00:42:47.704
One bar: nothing's wrong.
Two bars: nothing goes!

578
00:42:51.749 --> 00:42:53.082
Well apparently,
nothing goes!

579
00:42:53.124 --> 00:42:55.626
l know! That's why
I'm driving so slowly...

580
00:43:02.588 --> 00:43:05.297
Thank you for driving,
it was a pleasant trip.

581
00:43:05.506 --> 00:43:06.882
See you tonight, darling.

582
00:43:12.051 --> 00:43:15.011
I'll touch a word to my doctor, but
I'm afraid your case is desperate...

583
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:23.557
Pardon me for intruding,
but I'm running late!

584
00:43:30.311 --> 00:43:31.687
And here we go...

585
00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:52.573
Come in.

586
00:43:56.075 --> 00:43:57.076
Peek-a-boo!

587
00:43:57.118 --> 00:43:58.035
Hello...

588
00:43:58.785 --> 00:43:59.202
AAAH...!

589
00:44:03.579 --> 00:44:04.539
Are you ok?

590
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.831
l'm fine...
I'm fine...

591
00:44:06.873 --> 00:44:09.416
But you see, we're even betrayed
by our own equipment here!

592
00:44:09.457 --> 00:44:10.667
How am I supposed
to work like that?

593
00:44:11.083 --> 00:44:14.085
You should mention this in report.
We cruelly lack funding!

594
00:44:14.127 --> 00:44:17.337
We need more stable chairs,
and taller doors - see?

595
00:44:17.462 --> 00:44:19.838
Oh yeah, and we need
life jackets in our cars!

596
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.423
You were there earlier - blub!
See?

597
00:44:23.257 --> 00:44:25.883
Besides, our shoes could be
more comfortable, too...

598
00:44:26.509 --> 00:44:28.343
My feet hurt terribly!
Ouch!

599
00:44:29.635 --> 00:44:31.053
Maybe if you removed this...?

600
00:44:31.094 --> 00:44:31.595
Oh...?

601
00:44:31.929 --> 00:44:34.513
Wonder who did that,
I hate those practical jokes!

602
00:44:35.306 --> 00:44:39.016
I've had sore feet for six months!
That ain't funny!

603
00:44:39.433 --> 00:44:41.100
You know, this makes
me all tense!

604
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:46.312
Just relax, commissioner!
You are so nervous.

605
00:44:46.603 --> 00:44:49.646
lt's because of that gang,
the Santa Claus gang...

606
00:44:50.605 --> 00:44:54.024
Don't worry about it...
I'm going to take care of you.

607
00:44:58.234 --> 00:44:59.985
You know how to
use that thing?

608
00:45:00.319 --> 00:45:01.945
Yes, a little bit...

609
00:45:02.195 --> 00:45:06.948
They delivered it just last week.
Good thing I hid my typewriter!

610
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.367
Just relax, commissioner...

611
00:45:12.451 --> 00:45:16.328
You'll feel better so much better...

612
00:45:16.369 --> 00:45:17.370
You think so?

613
00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.371
l am sure.

614
00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.291
But now I can't see anything...
is that normal?

615
00:45:25.333 --> 00:45:28.626
Yes, it's normal.
Just relax!

616
00:45:33.128 --> 00:45:36.964
That feels so good... eh?

617
00:45:41.133 --> 00:45:44.469
I feel like you're taking
all my worries away...

618
00:45:48.221 --> 00:45:51.555
That's exactly the case...
You'll see...!

619
00:45:51.681 --> 00:45:54.057
I think I'm falling asleep...

620
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.558
l'll wake you up.

621
00:46:07.939 --> 00:46:09.065
That was terrific!

622
00:46:11.483 --> 00:46:14.485
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
You have any idea where you are?

623
00:46:14.526 --> 00:46:15.110
No, where am l?

624
00:46:15.151 --> 00:46:16.486
ln front of the police station!

625
00:46:16.527 --> 00:46:18.820
Oh, really? Looks more
like a garage to me...

626
00:46:18.863 --> 00:46:20.321
Just you wait, buddy...

627
00:46:23.573 --> 00:46:24.491
My respects, general!

628
00:46:24.616 --> 00:46:25.241
At ease!

629
00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:29.284
Thank you Daniel. l'll see you
tonight at home, then.

630
00:46:33.746 --> 00:46:35.872
Oh, Daniel! You're my savior!

631
00:46:36.372 --> 00:46:38.456
Could you do me a favor
and drop me somewhere?

632
00:46:38.498 --> 00:46:40.290
I don't drop my friends, but I can
give you a ride if you want...

633
00:46:40.332 --> 00:46:42.208
l am so glad to see you!

634
00:46:44.084 --> 00:46:46.253
Please, sir?
Has the problem subsided?

635
00:46:46.336 --> 00:46:47.586
Yes, I guess so...

636
00:46:47.628 --> 00:46:51.380
Oh, and would you please keep this
parking spot for me, I'll be back...

637
00:46:51.797 --> 00:46:52.631
Right...

638
00:46:57.592 --> 00:46:59.301
Hey, hey, slow down,
I got plenty of time!

639
00:46:59.343 --> 00:47:00.301
OK boss!

640
00:47:00.343 --> 00:47:02.094
Daniel, you won't believe
what's happening to me.

641
00:47:02.136 --> 00:47:03.762
Same here, you'll never guess
what's happening to me!

642
00:47:03.803 --> 00:47:06.555
Try to guess... it's something
absolutely unbelievable!

643
00:47:06.597 --> 00:47:07.389
You got promoted?

644
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:10.349
No it's not about my job,
it's personal... come on, guess!

645
00:47:10.391 --> 00:47:10.849
You're getting married?

646
00:47:10.891 --> 00:47:13.058
Better than that Daniel!
I'M GONNA BE A DADDY!

647
00:47:14.351 --> 00:47:15.226
But that's impossible!

648
00:47:15.269 --> 00:47:16.519
Yes it is possible!

649
00:47:17.019 --> 00:47:18.353
Oh, it's wonderful...!

650
00:47:19.521 --> 00:47:20.772
Lily is pregnant too.

651
00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:22.648
No way!

652
00:47:23.773 --> 00:47:27.233
But... that's awesome Daniel,
we'll be daddies together!

653
00:47:28.776 --> 00:47:32.444
That's unbelievable... after all these
years of friendship, we'll...

654
00:47:32.736 --> 00:47:34.320
we'll have a child together!

655
00:47:36.613 --> 00:47:39.115
I mean... uh...
I mean, one each...

656
00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.199
... but at the same time.

657
00:47:41.616 --> 00:47:42.659
Each of us separately!

658
00:47:43.075 --> 00:47:45.160
Yeah... separately, yes!

659
00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:47.869
How long has she been pregnant?

660
00:47:47.952 --> 00:47:48.703
8 months.

661
00:47:48.787 --> 00:47:50.371
8 months?!
You could've told me earlier!

662
00:47:50.454 --> 00:47:52.664
I only found out this morning!
You're the first one to know.

663
00:47:52.747 --> 00:47:55.791
I haven't even told mommy yet!
What about you - how long?

664
00:47:56.499 --> 00:47:57.208
2 bars.

665
00:47:57.917 --> 00:47:58.708
What do you mean, "2 bars"?

666
00:47:58.792 --> 00:48:00.794
Yeah, that's some new gadget...
you pee on it,

667
00:48:00.835 --> 00:48:02.460
and it tells you how long
you've been pregnant.

668
00:48:02.545 --> 00:48:04.336
And well, it's been
2 bars for her.

669
00:48:05.546 --> 00:48:07.463
Oh yeah? That's cool.

670
00:48:08.714 --> 00:48:09.756
Yeah, it's cool...

671
00:48:20.805 --> 00:48:24.347
Commissioner...?
You've got visitors!

672
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.015
What are you doing, Gibert?

673
00:48:26.641 --> 00:48:29.851
Aaah...!
It's a pleasure to see you again!

674
00:48:31.101 --> 00:48:33.311
Uh... that's nothing...
We were simply... that is...

675
00:48:33.352 --> 00:48:35.604
my colleague... she's Chinese...

676
00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:38.105
She was just showing me
a relaxation technique...

677
00:48:38.147 --> 00:48:40.816
How to get 5 hours of sleep
in 5 minutes... to save time.

678
00:48:40.857 --> 00:48:42.900
It gives you a lot of energy!

679
00:48:43.817 --> 00:48:47.902
However, today's class is over.
See you later, Commissioner!

680
00:48:47.944 --> 00:48:49.153
Thanks.

681
00:48:50.987 --> 00:48:52.697
Thanks, my little... Qiu.

682
00:48:56.949 --> 00:48:58.741
So, what can l do for you?

683
00:49:01.702 --> 00:49:05.204
She even put cauliflowers everywhere
in my office, but I was so busy...

684
00:49:05.245 --> 00:49:07.288
I didn't even notice that!
How stupid can I be?

685
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:09.998
Very stupid,
but I had already noticed...

686
00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.248
But why cauliflower?

687
00:49:12.083 --> 00:49:15.626
What do I know? But I should at
least have noticed something...

688
00:49:15.668 --> 00:49:18.127
But no, nothing!
I'm such a loser, Daniel...

689
00:49:18.169 --> 00:49:21.671
Oh, stop it. If you were such a loser,
you wouldn't be the father!

690
00:49:21.754 --> 00:49:22.504
You think so?

691
00:49:22.546 --> 00:49:24.172
Of course! Petra
isn't masochistic...!

692
00:49:25.631 --> 00:49:27.591
Thanks.
That's a bit reassuring.

693
00:49:27.632 --> 00:49:30.843
Oh, don't be too reassured,
we're still in deep shit!

694
00:49:31.176 --> 00:49:31.760
How's that?

695
00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.970
Well, you're always
chasing thieves...

696
00:49:34.011 --> 00:49:37.305
I'm always tinkering with an engine,
no wonder they're freaking out!

697
00:49:38.973 --> 00:49:42.099
And I'm not an expert, but a kid
must need some room... and time!

698
00:49:42.933 --> 00:49:46.017
Guess we'll have to change habits and
stop worrying only about our jobs...

699
00:49:46.059 --> 00:49:48.853
You're right! We have to watch him
take his first steps, go to school...

700
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.564
Oh, really?
So we'll have to seal them all up?

701
00:49:54.606 --> 00:49:55.440
I suppose so...

702
00:49:55.523 --> 00:49:59.609
Oh...? That's just insane...
How can you prepare for it?

703
00:50:01.276 --> 00:50:03.361
That's some good shit...
Did you get it from Rashid?

704
00:50:03.402 --> 00:50:06.279
Yep... hold on, you know Rashid?

705
00:50:06.363 --> 00:50:09.114
Well yeah, a little...

706
00:50:10.865 --> 00:50:12.116
The sun is coming out...

707
00:50:18.785 --> 00:50:22.622
Hey Daniel... Santa riding a scooter,
isn't that a bit weird?

708
00:50:24.831 --> 00:50:26.290
Yeah... he's supposed
to ride a sleigh...

709
00:50:27.332 --> 00:50:30.001
Watch this... he's discreet yet
nervous, that's not normal!

710
00:50:30.042 --> 00:50:33.586
Hey... just 5 minutes ago we agreed
to stop worrying about the job

711
00:50:33.628 --> 00:50:37.338
to spend more time with our kids,
so drop the hot pursuit idea!

712
00:50:37.546 --> 00:50:38.380
Follow him!

713
00:50:38.463 --> 00:50:40.256
Aye aye... Commissioner!

714
00:51:00.475 --> 00:51:04.019
I need verification on a scooter,
registration N 75BM13, over.

715
00:51:07.146 --> 00:51:08.397
It was stolen 2 weeks ago!

716
00:51:08.438 --> 00:51:10.231
Yes! You see,
it pays to persevere!

717
00:51:10.273 --> 00:51:12.149
You better tell Petra about it...

718
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:13.190
Daniel, we'll just follow it,

719
00:51:13.232 --> 00:51:15.901
localize his HQ and hand the case
over to Gibert. You have my word!

720
00:51:16.734 --> 00:51:17.360
Ok.

721
00:51:17.402 --> 00:51:19.861
You're a real friend,.
What would I do without you?

722
00:51:19.903 --> 00:51:21.112
Screw things up
even more?

723
00:51:21.154 --> 00:51:22.362
Yeah, for sure...

724
00:51:27.823 --> 00:51:30.075
We're losing him!
The first lead I got in 8 months,

725
00:51:30.117 --> 00:51:31.534
and I'm fucking losing it!

726
00:51:31.743 --> 00:51:34.244
Hey, calm down!
There's a solution to every problem.

727
00:51:35.077 --> 00:51:36.537
Daniel, what are you doing...?

728
00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.498
Daniel, what's wrong with you...!

729
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.416
You got a better idea
to follow a scooter?

730
00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:46.501
Uh... no!
But we'll get noticed!

731
00:51:46.751 --> 00:51:48.585
Just act naturally,
you'll be fine!

732
00:51:48.627 --> 00:51:51.336
"Act naturally"?
Oh, alright...

733
00:52:22.603 --> 00:52:26.105
So... now that you found his HQ,
you call the Commissioner!

734
00:52:26.147 --> 00:52:29.899
Hold on. I screwed up last time,
this time I want to make sure!

735
00:52:29.983 --> 00:52:34.235
Hey! You have a Santa, a stolen scooter
and an abandoned storehouse.

736
00:52:34.277 --> 00:52:35.903
What more do you want?
His legal file?

737
00:52:35.945 --> 00:52:38.654
I just want to make sure!
Come on, give me 5 minutes!

738
00:52:49.702 --> 00:52:50.744
Bingo!

739
00:52:50.786 --> 00:52:54.038
Is that enough, or you want to
check if they have real guns?

740
00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.539
Nah, that's ok...

741
00:52:56.581 --> 00:52:58.040
But we should find out
how many they are.

742
00:52:59.291 --> 00:53:00.124
Follow me!

743
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.544
Will you stop it? You said that you'll
hand the case to the commissioner.

744
00:53:05.586 --> 00:53:08.213
Yes, but the first question he'll ask
will be "how many are they?"

745
00:53:08.254 --> 00:53:10.547
And I need to know if this is their
HQ or only a secondary base.

746
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:12.215
Come on, just give me 5 minutes!

747
00:53:31.391 --> 00:53:33.643
Émilien, l got a bad feeling
about this. Don't do it!

748
00:53:33.685 --> 00:53:37.019
Don't worry, I've seen it in a movie.
You force the body to do what you want.

749
00:53:37.061 --> 00:53:37.854
It's all in your head.

750
00:53:37.895 --> 00:53:39.521
I know, that's what worries me!

751
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:41.147
If something happens to
me, you call Gibert.

752
00:53:41.189 --> 00:53:43.898
Émilien... your shoe's untied!

753
00:53:49.568 --> 00:53:51.319
Oh dear...

754
00:53:57.448 --> 00:53:58.073
Hello?

755
00:53:58.115 --> 00:53:59.907
I'm back from my physician,
does that interest you?

756
00:54:00.491 --> 00:54:02.450
Oh yes, if he's a good doctor!

757
00:54:02.492 --> 00:54:03.909
He's an excellent doctor!

758
00:54:04.034 --> 00:54:07.995
The prefect's daughter recommended him,
and she had 4 children in 4 years!

759
00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:10.163
Well that's gonna be tough to beat...

760
00:54:10.205 --> 00:54:11.831
Yes, especially if we don't
see each other again!

761
00:54:11.873 --> 00:54:15.791
Listen Lily. I'll do anything, but
you should give me a chance!

762
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.208
So what I propose is...

763
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:18.917
Why are you whispering like that?

764
00:54:18.959 --> 00:54:21.378
Because of the Santas! They just
pulled Émilen out of the trash can

765
00:54:21.419 --> 00:54:22.879
and I think they're going to...

766
00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.005
Lily? Lily!

767
00:54:27.047 --> 00:54:28.089
Oh shit...

768
00:54:47.683 --> 00:54:48.934
But... what are
you doing here?

769
00:54:49.768 --> 00:54:50.602
Guess...

770
00:54:50.935 --> 00:54:54.562
You're wasting your time.
Torture me, I won't say a word!

771
00:54:54.604 --> 00:54:57.022
We do not need
to make you talk.

772
00:54:57.063 --> 00:55:01.441
We already know everything.
Besides, torture is out of fashion.

773
00:55:02.275 --> 00:55:06.193
There are much more effective
methods to make a man talking.

774
00:55:06.235 --> 00:55:07.069
No kidding?

775
00:55:08.945 --> 00:55:10.988
For example, tenderness...

776
00:55:12.281 --> 00:55:14.782
lt can be a very
dangerous weapon.

777
00:55:16.033 --> 00:55:19.535
Tell me, what is a handsome man
like you doing in a place like this?

778
00:55:19.576 --> 00:55:21.869
Just doing my job...
Ah, no! Don't do that!

779
00:55:22.702 --> 00:55:26.204
Yet you are not insensible
to my "arguments"...

780
00:55:26.246 --> 00:55:28.039
Yes I am!
That's my cell phone!

781
00:55:28.122 --> 00:55:30.207
Ah...? Let's have a look...

782
00:55:31.457 --> 00:55:33.751
Oh, what a nice model!

783
00:55:34.793 --> 00:55:37.252
But it's shut off...
I'm going to turn it on.

784
00:55:37.295 --> 00:55:38.545
No!
You can't do that!

785
00:55:39.379 --> 00:55:40.796
I'm out of credits...

786
00:55:41.047 --> 00:55:42.505
That's against basic
human rights!

787
00:55:51.135 --> 00:55:52.928
That's inhuman,
what you're doing to me...

788
00:55:54.637 --> 00:55:57.096
They say hunger justifies the means...

789
00:55:57.306 --> 00:56:00.015
and l am very hungry!

790
00:56:07.311 --> 00:56:09.562
Petra!

791
00:56:09.603 --> 00:56:13.773
Can't answer now because I'm very busy.
Leave your ID and I'll keep you posted.

792
00:56:14.065 --> 00:56:18.150
Émilien, it's Petra. l guess you
are on a mission again.

793
00:56:19.818 --> 00:56:21.902
I just wanted to tell you
that I am proud of you.

794
00:56:21.944 --> 00:56:24.195
Of your dedication
to your work.

795
00:56:24.403 --> 00:56:26.905
I know how you put all your
energy in everything you do.

796
00:56:27.322 --> 00:56:29.489
But you should also think about
yourself from time to time.

797
00:56:30.074 --> 00:56:32.741
You should relax a little,
find some pleasure in life.

798
00:56:33.575 --> 00:56:36.285
And maybe we could spend
a little more time together...

799
00:56:36.535 --> 00:56:40.037
That's all. Call me back
when you're done. Kiss!

800
00:56:44.873 --> 00:56:45.873
Hello Daniel...!

801
00:56:50.668 --> 00:56:53.336
Why are you still here? Have you
seen Émilien, I can't find him!

802
00:56:53.377 --> 00:56:54.795
Actually I have seen him,
he got kidnapped!

803
00:56:54.837 --> 00:56:56.879
Kidnapped?! You're kidding,
what good would that do?

804
00:56:56.921 --> 00:56:59.423
What do I know! They were all disguised
as Santa and loaded with weapons!

805
00:56:59.465 --> 00:57:01.091
Dressed as Santa? It must
be the Santa Claus gang!

806
00:57:01.507 --> 00:57:02.716
I guessed that much...

807
00:57:02.757 --> 00:57:04.843
Good job, Émilien! He picked up their
trail again - by himself!

808
00:57:04.884 --> 00:57:05.634
Actually we BOTH did!

809
00:57:05.676 --> 00:57:08.595
They're as good as dead!
I got an infaillible plan!

810
00:57:08.928 --> 00:57:09.845
And Émilien?

811
00:57:10.471 --> 00:57:12.347
He'll be fine Daniel, trust me!

812
00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:15.765
Get in the car!

813
00:57:16.515 --> 00:57:21.102
Would you mind sticking around with us?
I got a BAD feeling about this mission!

814
00:57:21.143 --> 00:57:21.935
And Émilien?

815
00:57:22.352 --> 00:57:23.186
Ah, Émilien...

816
00:57:24.019 --> 00:57:25.687
Once we find the Santa Claus
gang, we find Émilien...

817
00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:28.814
but... will he still be alive?
Who knows...

818
00:57:29.856 --> 00:57:30.898
That's promising...

819
00:57:40.278 --> 00:57:41.196
Commissioner!

820
00:57:41.321 --> 00:57:42.571
Ah, good timing!

821
00:57:43.197 --> 00:57:44.656
We're just about to catch
the Santa Claus gang,

822
00:57:44.698 --> 00:57:47.991
we'll throw them right
into the sack, those Santas!

823
00:57:48.825 --> 00:57:50.701
Can... can I come with you, please?

824
00:57:50.743 --> 00:57:52.535
Absolutely not.
It's way too dangerous,

825
00:57:52.577 --> 00:57:55.286
and this arrest won't be a pretty
Christmas story, trust me!

826
00:57:55.912 --> 00:57:59.038
Oh, Commissioner... please...

827
00:57:59.248 --> 00:58:01.540
Uh...? OK, let's go then,
it's not very far...

828
00:58:02.374 --> 00:58:04.626
Hey!
Follow us, ok?

829
00:58:19.884 --> 00:58:20.717
Spread out!

830
00:58:29.264 --> 00:58:30.515
Yep, Christmas time is here!

831
00:58:30.556 --> 00:58:34.142
I'm gonna hit them with some
early fireworks, wait and see!

832
00:58:34.392 --> 00:58:35.684
How do you know they are here?

833
00:58:35.726 --> 00:58:39.895
I got my own spies! My brother Jean-
Robert works with the City Sewage...

834
00:58:39.936 --> 00:58:42.812
he took the police exam
with me, but failed...

835
00:58:42.855 --> 00:58:44.147
even though he copied
everything off me!

836
00:58:44.188 --> 00:58:48.024
but he messed up the order of the
answers, so he got it all wrong!

837
00:58:48.065 --> 00:58:50.484
You know, that happens all the time!
A friend of mine...

838
00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:51.526
Ok, ok, enough!

839
00:58:51.776 --> 00:58:53.652
Anyway, he called me last night

840
00:58:53.693 --> 00:58:57.195
and told me about suspicious activities
in the mall, so I investigated...

841
00:58:57.237 --> 00:59:01.157
And what did I find? A tunnel
between the bank and the mall!

842
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:05.950
Of course! That way they'll steal
the money and spend it right away!

843
00:59:06.075 --> 00:59:12.204
No! Sunday, they'll rob the CLOSED bank
and leave by the OPEN mall - as Santa!

844
00:59:12.246 --> 00:59:14.789
Of course! Nobody will notice them
since there are Santas everywhere!

845
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:17.624
Exactly! And that's why they've been
dressing up as Santa from the beginning

846
00:59:17.666 --> 00:59:19.917
in preparation of that hold-up!
It's the biggest bank in Marseille.

847
00:59:20.417 --> 00:59:22.834
Of course, of course...!
Commissioner, you are a genius!

848
00:59:22.877 --> 00:59:25.961
No, no, Alain... I got an inherent
talent, that's true...

849
00:59:26.253 --> 00:59:28.254
but it's really just a
question of training.

850
00:59:29.088 --> 00:59:30.005
It is!

851
00:59:30.256 --> 00:59:31.339
Can l make a phone call?

852
00:59:31.381 --> 00:59:32.215
Suit yourself!

853
00:59:34.091 --> 00:59:35.967
Oh, ain't that funny,
Émilien's got the same one!

854
00:59:40.928 --> 00:59:41.387
Yes.

855
00:59:41.804 --> 00:59:43.721
The stupid cops found out everything.

856
00:59:43.763 --> 00:59:46.181
Switch to plan B.

857
00:59:47.015 --> 00:59:48.683
- OK!
- OK. Bye.

858
00:59:49.433 --> 00:59:51.809
That's such a nice language...
I mean, Chinese...

859
00:59:52.101 --> 00:59:53.060
It just melts in your ear!

860
00:59:53.143 --> 00:59:54.519
Chief, there's activity
in the parking lot.

861
00:59:54.561 --> 00:59:58.896
On your marks. If that four wheeled
monster appears, nail it on the spot!

862
00:59:59.021 --> 01:00:00.147
Roger that!

863
01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:03.357
The Christmas vacation is over,
Gibert will make sure of that!

864
01:00:06.526 --> 01:00:07.526
What the hell is that?

865
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:10.986
Hey, where's that
big monster truck?

866
01:00:13.279 --> 01:00:16.614
They're getting away!
Do something!

867
01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:20.575
l commandeer this vehicle.
Alain, follow me!

868
01:00:38.293 --> 01:00:41.212
We have a beautiful view
over Marseille from here.

869
01:00:41.295 --> 01:00:44.088
l see that. ls it quiet,
in wintertime?

870
01:00:44.129 --> 01:00:45.047
Oh yes, very quiet.

871
01:00:45.089 --> 01:00:46.005
STOP!

872
01:00:50.175 --> 01:00:51.258
Commissioner, wait for me!

873
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:53.927
Stop... in the name of the Law!

874
01:00:54.552 --> 01:00:58.096
Like I told you, Minister,
we are cruelly underfunded.

875
01:00:58.137 --> 01:01:01.223
Indeed... one bike for two
officers, that's too little.

876
01:01:01.306 --> 01:01:02.681
Way too little, yes...

877
01:01:57.169 --> 01:02:00.088
Tell the chopper pilot
we'll be in time.

878
01:02:07.092 --> 01:02:09.593
l will miss you,
my little Émilien...

879
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:13.137
But because l like you,
I won't make you suffer...

880
01:02:13.178 --> 01:02:13.720
Gee, thanks...

881
01:02:13.762 --> 01:02:18.556
You will even have the privilege to
know the exact time of your death

882
01:02:18.598 --> 01:02:22.350
thanks to this highly precise
device... that's my Swiss side...!

883
01:02:31.688 --> 01:02:37.734
This device will set free that ball,
which will swing along the cable...

884
01:02:37.776 --> 01:02:40.652
and you'll have the
best seat for the show.

885
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:43.737
Uh... how much time will I have?

886
01:02:43.779 --> 01:02:46.280
You'll have exactly 5 minutes.

887
01:02:46.906 --> 01:02:47.531
Great...!

888
01:02:47.572 --> 01:02:51.908
Use your time well to purify
your soul, Émilien...

889
01:02:51.949 --> 01:02:55.869
It is important to thoroughly clean
your soul and come to peace...

890
01:02:55.911 --> 01:02:58.370
before you face your Maker.

891
01:02:58.412 --> 01:03:00.663
Only 5 minutes to clean up that
mess, that's a little tight there...

892
01:03:01.079 --> 01:03:02.539
Focus on the essential, then...

893
01:03:10.544 --> 01:03:13.170
I'm keeping your cell
phone as a souvenir.

894
01:03:13.795 --> 01:03:15.462
I am a bit sentimental...

895
01:03:16.297 --> 01:03:17.756
that's my Chinese side.

896
01:03:26.719 --> 01:03:28.804
Clean up my soul...
Yeah, right...!

897
01:03:42.769 --> 01:03:44.854
Right here and now, I would
sure appreciate a miracle!

898
01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:46.104
Even a small one...!

899
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.859
Oh no, not the ball...!

900
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:57.152
Oh no, not the taxi!

901
01:04:06.032 --> 01:04:09.867
Daniel! You can't imagine
what has happened to me.

902
01:04:09.992 --> 01:04:13.828
lt was terrible, we must find her!
She took my cell phone...

903
01:04:14.662 --> 01:04:16.955
I mean, they also got
all the money...

904
01:04:16.996 --> 01:04:19.457
but the cell phone... that cell
phone was a gift from Petra!

905
01:04:19.498 --> 01:04:22.374
Imagine what would happen if she
calls and a Chinese girl answers...

906
01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:25.710
Uh, Émilien...? Tell me, did I just
save your life or was it a dream?

907
01:04:25.751 --> 01:04:28.377
Well, yes... so what? I would've
done the same for you!

908
01:04:28.419 --> 01:04:31.546
Oh yeah? That way I would have died
crushed by a cop car, that's great!

909
01:04:31.963 --> 01:04:34.256
Don't say that. My driving
has improved a lot!

910
01:04:34.465 --> 01:04:37.550
But your manners haven't! How about
saying "thank you for saving my life"?

911
01:04:37.592 --> 01:04:40.718
If I don't catch that gang,
you saved my life for nothing.

912
01:04:40.926 --> 01:04:43.011
Gibert will kill me because
I screwed up again!

913
01:04:43.178 --> 01:04:46.304
We'll find that gang, but first,
tell me: ''Thank you''!

914
01:04:46.346 --> 01:04:50.098
Oh yeah? How are we gonna find
it, we don't have a single clue!

915
01:04:50.139 --> 01:04:51.349
Say: "Thank you"!

916
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:52.975
THANK YOU!
THERE, ARE YOU HAPPY?

917
01:04:53.016 --> 01:04:54.101
YEAH!

918
01:04:59.186 --> 01:05:01.563
l'm sorry, buddy.
I'm so sorry!

919
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:05.523
It's... it's my nerves, I just
can't take it anymore.

920
01:05:06.774 --> 01:05:08.441
The Chinese girl, she...

921
01:05:09.067 --> 01:05:11.985
She tortured me for hours,
it's hard to recover from it.

922
01:05:12.611 --> 01:05:13.652
She tortured you?

923
01:05:13.694 --> 01:05:15.528
Yes. lt was terrible!

924
01:05:17.196 --> 01:05:18.030
What kind of tortures?

925
01:05:18.072 --> 01:05:20.115
Oh my, she did things I didn't
even know you could do!

926
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:24.700
l mean, you can't imagine the things
she did. In fact I'm still sore...

927
01:05:25.951 --> 01:05:28.661
I mean, it hurts me just
from talking about it, Daniel.

928
01:05:29.578 --> 01:05:30.537
l see.

929
01:05:32.413 --> 01:05:36.040
Don't worry... we'll catch that
Chinese chick. Come with me.

930
01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:40.917
Did you see, did you overhear
anything that could help us?

931
01:05:40.959 --> 01:05:41.585
No...

932
01:05:41.793 --> 01:05:45.129
She was telling about a chopper pilot
set to pick them up somewhere, but...

933
01:05:45.545 --> 01:05:46.796
She had fur on her boots.

934
01:05:46.838 --> 01:05:47.838
Fur on her boots?

935
01:05:49.297 --> 01:05:50.298
You don't feel anything?

936
01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:50.965
No...

937
01:05:51.382 --> 01:05:52.216
It's cold...

938
01:05:52.633 --> 01:05:54.509
Oh yeah, you're right...
is that melted snow?

939
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:58.261
Yes. And that means two things.
It's from somewhere high up and nearby.

940
01:05:59.094 --> 01:06:01.804
And... since they were wearing fur
boots, they're going back there...?

941
01:06:02.638 --> 01:06:03.680
Probably...

942
01:06:04.097 --> 01:06:06.390
But why would they take all that
money on a mountain top?

943
01:06:06.598 --> 01:06:07.849
What's on the other side
of the mountain...?

944
01:06:10.768 --> 01:06:12.018
Switzerland...

945
01:06:12.644 --> 01:06:13.685
But of course!

946
01:06:13.894 --> 01:06:16.604
Daniel, she's half Swiss,
so she knows the place!

947
01:06:16.812 --> 01:06:19.272
They'll travel by car as high as
possible, then ski back down...

948
01:06:19.313 --> 01:06:21.399
and what with all the tourists
there, nobody will notice them!

949
01:06:21.732 --> 01:06:24.525
And from the Swiss ski station,
they're taking a chopper to the bank!

950
01:06:24.566 --> 01:06:25.984
That plan is awesome!

951
01:06:28.277 --> 01:06:30.987
So now we're looking for a ski station
that's close to the Swiss border...

952
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:34.322
where you can land a chopper
and has a lot of tourists.

953
01:06:36.407 --> 01:06:37.866
- Val d'lsère!
- Val d'lsère!

954
01:06:47.454 --> 01:06:48.454
Did you just see something?

955
01:06:48.497 --> 01:06:49.955
No. Absolutely nothing.

956
01:06:50.581 --> 01:06:53.291
Sentinel N1, negative.
Nothing to report here.

957
01:06:53.916 --> 01:06:55.167
So where are you going
to spend your holidays?

958
01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:58.085
Bof, we haven't decided yet...
Probably in the snow somewhere.

959
01:07:28.519 --> 01:07:31.228
Now we can only hope that we
were right in our deductions...

960
01:07:31.437 --> 01:07:33.688
and their car is around
here somewhere.

961
01:07:33.729 --> 01:07:35.815
You look on the right,
I'll look on the left.

962
01:07:35.898 --> 01:07:36.648
OK.

963
01:07:39.357 --> 01:07:41.859
Émilien, don't tell me you can't
tell your right from your left!

964
01:07:41.943 --> 01:07:44.569
Oh, you mean on
YOUR right side!

965
01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:46.445
I'm in front of you,
so that's MY left...

966
01:07:46.528 --> 01:07:48.321
You're not in front of me,
you're sitting besides me!

967
01:07:48.362 --> 01:07:51.448
Yes, but I imagined I was sitting
in front of you, and if I was, I...

968
01:07:52.699 --> 01:07:53.282
What...?

969
01:07:53.324 --> 01:07:54.575
Daniel! The car!

970
01:07:55.616 --> 01:07:56.242
Got'cha!

971
01:07:56.867 --> 01:07:58.535
Let's take a shortcut, turn
right as soon as you can!

972
01:07:58.785 --> 01:07:59.744
Why, you know this place?

973
01:07:59.786 --> 01:08:03.121
Never mind, all these ski stations
are the same. Turn right, trust me!

974
01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:06.039
Tell you what, I'd rather
trust myself and turn... right!

975
01:08:09.791 --> 01:08:10.834
Watch out!

976
01:08:16.795 --> 01:08:17.713
That was a close one!

977
01:08:19.797 --> 01:08:20.839
What is this road, Daniel?

978
01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.715
l don't know,
watch out for signs!

979
01:08:27.093 --> 01:08:29.177
Don't these cars look a bit strange?

980
01:08:29.385 --> 01:08:32.095
Nah, they're local plates...
Must be ski instructors...

981
01:08:32.136 --> 01:08:33.346
What are those signs saying?

982
01:08:34.597 --> 01:08:37.056
Says "1 min 10 sec, 2nd place"
Isn't that disturbing?

983
01:08:37.098 --> 01:08:38.557
Not at all, we'll do better
on the second lap...

984
01:09:02.153 --> 01:09:03.363
Oh shit...

985
01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:05.447
Look, those tracks
are from a ratrack!

986
01:09:05.489 --> 01:09:07.531
They must have transferred the
money into it and continued uphill.

987
01:09:08.156 --> 01:09:10.199
We'll never catch them,
the pursuit is over!

988
01:09:10.241 --> 01:09:11.700
The pursuit never stops.

989
01:09:16.911 --> 01:09:20.663
Daniel, I know you're fast, but
a taxi can't climb a mountain!

990
01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.539
Nothing is impossible
to a stout heart!

991
01:09:30.252 --> 01:09:32.128
What do you think about
my winter collection?

992
01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:35.255
Oh yeah, not bad at all!

993
01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:37.089
Tell me, you've tested this, right?

994
01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:37.965
No, never...

995
01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:48.178
Hey, it seems to be working!

996
01:09:48.387 --> 01:09:49.179
Yeah I guess so...

997
01:09:49.221 --> 01:09:51.305
But how are we going to
find them in all that snow?

998
01:09:51.347 --> 01:09:53.765
How about following
their tracks, for example?

999
01:09:53.806 --> 01:09:55.892
Oh yes, that's a clever idea!

1000
01:09:59.018 --> 01:10:01.520
If they manage to escape in a chopper,
is your taxi equipped for that?

1001
01:10:01.728 --> 01:10:04.229
Émilien, don't overdo it! That's
already pretty good, don't you think?

1002
01:10:04.271 --> 01:10:07.148
Oh, I'm not complaining! But maybe
I should call the general, then...

1003
01:10:07.356 --> 01:10:08.607
What an excellent idea!

1004
01:10:08.815 --> 01:10:11.525
Uh, can I borrow your cell phone?
The Chinese girl still got mine...

1005
01:10:17.779 --> 01:10:22.156
Put the money into the rucksacks.
We must leave before sundown.

1006
01:10:31.536 --> 01:10:32.370
Back to work!

1007
01:10:41.124 --> 01:10:42.167
You think they are still there?

1008
01:10:42.583 --> 01:10:43.626
That's hard to say...

1009
01:10:49.046 --> 01:10:49.671
Hello?

1010
01:10:49.796 --> 01:10:52.756
Oh, Émilien! Operation ''Snow-white''
has already started.

1011
01:10:52.798 --> 01:10:56.716
I'll be with you in 10 minutes.
Your Commissioner is with me,

1012
01:10:56.758 --> 01:10:58.634
he insisted to participate
in the operation!

1013
01:10:58.842 --> 01:11:00.302
Oh, no...!

1014
01:11:01.553 --> 01:11:02.803
- Commissioner!
- Yes?

1015
01:11:03.429 --> 01:11:04.887
Are you sure that's a good idea?

1016
01:11:06.138 --> 01:11:09.223
Alain, l served for 18 months
in the Chasseurs Alpins,

1017
01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:13.600
13th batallion, special forces!
So I know about mountains!

1018
01:11:13.725 --> 01:11:15.936
Alright, but... we are high up here!

1019
01:11:15.977 --> 01:11:17.602
Have you ever seen
snow before, Alain?

1020
01:11:17.812 --> 01:11:19.478
Well... you know,
I'm from around here...!

1021
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:22.814
Ah...? Oh.
Ok then, let's go!

1022
01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:25.524
Ok, hit the road!

1023
01:11:26.774 --> 01:11:28.608
I'm going to take a look.
Don't want to take chances.

1024
01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:29.651
I wouldn't do that
if I were you...

1025
01:11:29.693 --> 01:11:30.944
Relax, just give
me 5 minutes...

1026
01:11:33.195 --> 01:11:35.321
Damn it - it's always
the same story!

1027
01:11:44.284 --> 01:11:46.660
You were right.
We should stay together.

1028
01:11:51.163 --> 01:11:53.872
See that? You could have waited
instead of ruining my carpet...

1029
01:11:53.914 --> 01:11:54.998
Take it easy, it's just water!

1030
01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.000
No, for now it's still snow,
and snow leaves traces!

1031
01:11:58.042 --> 01:11:59.250
Alright, I'll clean up
your fucking car!

1032
01:11:59.292 --> 01:12:00.710
Oh yeah? How are you
gonna do that?

1033
01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:04.503
l said, l'll clean it!
How, is my problem!

1034
01:12:12.007 --> 01:12:13.050
Come on! Let's go.

1035
01:12:18.178 --> 01:12:19.053
You know how to ski?

1036
01:12:19.095 --> 01:12:20.137
No, but I know
how to drive!

1037
01:13:31.635 --> 01:13:33.719
Damn it!
Follow me!

1038
01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.097
Hey! lt's a forest, Daniel!

1039
01:13:39.139 --> 01:13:40.348
So what? Are you scared in a forest?

1040
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:41.641
No, I'm scared in a car!

1041
01:13:45.809 --> 01:13:47.685
Uh... what... what are
you doing, Daniel?

1042
01:13:48.102 --> 01:13:49.978
Well, I think I can put
the tires back on now...

1043
01:13:54.981 --> 01:13:57.690
There, we localized the chopper!
Get ready!

1044
01:14:01.443 --> 01:14:02.860
Chief! Are you sure that...?

1045
01:14:02.902 --> 01:14:06.445
Shut up Alain, I checked everything
myself this time. I'll be just fine!

1046
01:14:06.654 --> 01:14:08.405
Ok boys, here we go!

1047
01:14:31.251 --> 01:14:32.084
What happened?

1048
01:14:37.296 --> 01:14:38.963
Wait for me-e-aah!

1049
01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:52.680
I think the cord is
a little too short...

1050
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:54.597
Of course it's too short!

1051
01:14:57.515 --> 01:14:58.558
Wait, you can't do that!

1052
01:14:58.599 --> 01:14:59.809
Oh yeah? Watch me!

1053
01:15:03.143 --> 01:15:03.769
There we go.

1054
01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:06.478
Wait for me...!

1055
01:15:15.442 --> 01:15:20.236
And here comes Hans Gerhardt,
from Austria, he's the number 10...

1056
01:15:20.278 --> 01:15:21.904
in a great shape this season...

1057
01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.656
Are you sure we're on the road?

1058
01:15:25.698 --> 01:15:28.157
I think that as long as we
follow these poles, we're good...

1059
01:15:28.866 --> 01:15:32.952
After his record in Kitzbühl and
on this optimal race track,

1060
01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.287
it's hard to think of anybody
that could outrace him...

1061
01:15:40.872 --> 01:15:44.416
He has set a record
on all intermediary times...

1062
01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:50.461
He is literally flying across
this World Championship...

1063
01:15:56.298 --> 01:15:59.216
This victory cannot escape him...

1064
01:16:02.551 --> 01:16:06.636
Ooops - it did. A... taxi...
beats him by a split-second.

1065
01:16:23.605 --> 01:16:24.855
lt's too calm...

1066
01:16:42.781 --> 01:16:44.657
You could leave me
a little souvenir...

1067
01:16:44.699 --> 01:16:46.533
Souvenirs aren't allowed
where you're headed to.

1068
01:16:46.742 --> 01:16:48.618
However, you will have
plenty of time to clean up!

1069
01:16:50.494 --> 01:16:51.536
Ok, take her away!

1070
01:16:55.913 --> 01:17:00.083
Tell me, you don't seem to be very angry
considering she tortured you for hours!

1071
01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:02.959
Well... bygones are
bygones, right?

1072
01:17:03.001 --> 01:17:03.418
Sure...

1073
01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.086
Oh, by the way, you haven't seen
Gibert? Shouldn't he be here?

1074
01:17:06.128 --> 01:17:07.379
l'm coming!

1075
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.838
Well yeah, there he is!

1076
01:17:09.046 --> 01:17:12.339
O- oh! l am comi-i-ng!

1077
01:17:12.381 --> 01:17:15.299
Chief! Be careful when
you're landing!

1078
01:17:15.508 --> 01:17:18.635
Oh, don't worry Émilien,
it's just snow...

1079
01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.344
Banzai...!

1080
01:17:23.638 --> 01:17:25.722
Oh dear... the water must
be pretty cool, too!

1081
01:17:33.851 --> 01:17:34.477
Hello!

1082
01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.186
Émilien? My waters broke,
I'm about to give birth!

1083
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:39.437
What, you're giving birth?
Here? Right now?

1084
01:17:39.479 --> 01:17:40.897
Well it's gonna take some
time, but hurry up!

1085
01:17:40.938 --> 01:17:43.231
I'm coming Petra!
I'll be there right away!

1086
01:17:46.775 --> 01:17:48.860
Commissioner!
Petra is having a baby!

1087
01:17:49.902 --> 01:17:51.778
And guess who's getting
another job...

1088
01:17:51.986 --> 01:17:53.029
Daniel!

1089
01:17:59.698 --> 01:18:03.868
l'm here, l'm here!
Everything will be fine now.

1090
01:18:04.701 --> 01:18:07.620
I beg you, please don't faint!
It's not the right time for this!

1091
01:18:07.662 --> 01:18:11.164
Don't worry, everything be fine.
You hear me? You'll be fine!

1092
01:18:13.665 --> 01:18:15.541
Émilien, that's not the right time!
You gotta cope with this!

1093
01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:19.709
Watch over the monitor.
You'll see the contractions coming.

1094
01:18:19.794 --> 01:18:21.795
- I'll see contractions on a screen?
- Yes.

1095
01:18:22.003 --> 01:18:24.712
Watch a screen, watch a screen...
which one shows contractions?

1096
01:18:24.796 --> 01:18:25.922
It must be this one...

1097
01:18:27.423 --> 01:18:28.048
Yes, it's that one!

1098
01:18:28.089 --> 01:18:29.090
Push! Push!

1099
01:18:29.299 --> 01:18:30.549
But where do I push?

1100
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:33.051
Not you! She has to push
at every contraction!

1101
01:18:33.467 --> 01:18:34.302
Contractions!

1102
01:18:35.385 --> 01:18:38.054
Push, honey, push, push!

1103
01:18:38.262 --> 01:18:39.930
Now breathe, breathe!

1104
01:18:41.388 --> 01:18:43.890
Not you! She has to breathe!

1105
01:18:43.932 --> 01:18:46.183
Breathe darling, breathe, breathe!

1106
01:18:48.059 --> 01:18:48.893
Contractions!

1107
01:18:49.518 --> 01:18:52.186
Push! Push!

1108
01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.270
Get out of here!

1109
01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:56.980
Push! Get it out of here!
Come on, push, push!

1110
01:18:57.022 --> 01:18:57.814
Now breathe...

1111
01:18:57.855 --> 01:19:01.608
Ok, breathe!
Man the bellows, breathe, breathe!

1112
01:19:04.651 --> 01:19:06.152
Ok, one more time,
I can see the head!

1113
01:19:06.194 --> 01:19:07.445
The head...?

1114
01:19:07.486 --> 01:19:08.486
Contractions, Émilien!

1115
01:19:08.528 --> 01:19:13.489
Ok darling, push the head!
Push the head! Push it outta there!

1116
01:19:13.531 --> 01:19:14.532
Contractions!

1117
01:19:15.157 --> 01:19:16.158
Almost there!

1118
01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.743
One more time my love, push!
Push! Breathe! Sneeze! Puke!

1119
01:19:20.785 --> 01:19:22.453
Ok, now relax.

1120
01:19:25.162 --> 01:19:27.456
Relax, relax, relax...

1121
01:19:28.915 --> 01:19:30.373
It's a beautiful baby boy.

1122
01:19:30.582 --> 01:19:31.624
Relax everything...

1123
01:19:40.379 --> 01:19:41.839
I'm a daddy...

1124
01:19:45.173 --> 01:19:46.632
Would you like to cut
the umbilical cord?

1125
01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:52.678
Maybe we should wait a little
with that if you don't mind...

1126
01:20:10.187 --> 01:20:11.438
What are you doing here?

1127
01:20:11.521 --> 01:20:12.480
Training...

1128
01:20:13.106 --> 01:20:14.357
Why? Are you pregnant?

1129
01:20:14.773 --> 01:20:16.441
No, but the woman
l love is pregnant.

1130
01:20:17.274 --> 01:20:18.942
And I want to be ready
when my time comes.

1131
01:20:20.401 --> 01:20:24.362
Where did you find a woman stupid enough
to have a baby with a draft of air?

1132
01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:28.322
l was very lucky.
And I promised her things.

1133
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:29.781
Like what?

1134
01:20:30.406 --> 01:20:34.534
To spend more time with her than with
my car, to become the best of daddies...

1135
01:20:34.576 --> 01:20:35.201
And the fridge?

1136
01:20:35.243 --> 01:20:36.034
The fridge is empty!

1137
01:20:36.452 --> 01:20:40.204
I would also be the best of husbands,
if she agrees to marry me, that is...

1138
01:20:41.454 --> 01:20:42.288
And did she believe you?

1139
01:20:42.497 --> 01:20:43.330
Not at all!

1140
01:20:44.164 --> 01:20:46.624
In fact, it's the first time in her life
that she made a real mistake.

1141
01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.167
Because right now,
I was absolutely sincere.

1142
01:20:51.877 --> 01:20:54.795
What men lack is not sincerity,
it's the time to apply it.

1143
01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:57.713
The time to make all these
nice words possible.

1144
01:20:59.381 --> 01:21:01.048
Lily, would you marry me?

1145
01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:04.592
That's easy, now that you made me
pregnant, you feel compelled...

1146
01:21:04.717 --> 01:21:05.426
Lily!

1147
01:21:06.885 --> 01:21:10.846
In any case, you're not doing it right.
We are very traditional in our family!

1148
01:21:14.806 --> 01:21:17.516
Lily, would you give me the
honour to become my wife?

1149
01:21:18.975 --> 01:21:19.809
It depends...

1150
01:21:20.226 --> 01:21:21.268
Depends on what?

1151
01:21:22.227 --> 01:21:23.770
On how good of
a lover you are...

1152
01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.021
You got one hour
to convince me!

1153
01:21:26.062 --> 01:21:27.105
You'll never last!

1154
01:21:27.522 --> 01:21:28.563
Wanna bet?

1155
01:21:29.606 --> 01:21:32.315
"Intensive care"

1156
01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:40.654
Émilien...

1157
01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:44.614
Émilien!
