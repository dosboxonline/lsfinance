1
00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.550
Left! 3rd!

2
00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:13.550
Here's Jean-Louis Schlesser
in his mean machine,

3
00:01:13.717 --> 00:01:17.217
Proudly bearing the number 10,
like soccer star Zidane

4
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.967
30 meters, then left and brake!

5
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.967
World rally champion in both '98 and '99...

6
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.633
...winner of the Paris - Dakar rallye:
He's the man to beat!

7
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.300
Left, top speed!

8
00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.883
Hey Jean-Louis, get a move on!
We're about to get slaughtered!

9
00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:47.550
I'm pedal to the metal!

10
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.967
The guy behind must have a
longer pedal then! Watch out!

11
00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.467
That asshole's actually flashing me!
Isn't that Vatanen?

12
00:01:58.883 --> 00:02:00.300
Err... no, it's a taxi!

13
00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:05.883
Are you gonna move your trash away or not?
You know, I'm working here!

14
00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:07.882
You're sure we're one the right road?

15
00:02:07.883 --> 00:02:09.300
Don't worry, it's a short cut!

16
00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:11.092
A short cut...?

17
00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:12.800
Are you gonna allow a TAXI to pass you?

18
00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:14.050
No freakin' way!

19
00:02:18.383 --> 00:02:22.175
I don't believe this! Sorry, folks,
there's some tourist holding up traffic!

20
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.258
Looks more like a race car to me...!

21
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.633
Nah, just some jerk showing off
with a couple o' race stickers...

22
00:02:27.717 --> 00:02:30.883
You know, a taxi on our tail will sure
look bad at the finish line!

23
00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:32.717
Don't worry, there's an opening...
I'll shake him off!

24
00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.550
D'you see that?
That asshole rammed me!

25
00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:41.383
I'm gonna have to pass him
or we'll be here all week!

26
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.550
Don't worry honey, we're almost there!

27
00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:00.800
Why... why are there so many people here?

28
00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:02.883
Of course they are!
They're on vacation!

29
00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:04.633
Aah, I see...!

30
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.967
Go, Jean Louis!
Bravo, Jean Louis!

31
00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.467
And here's number 10...
It's NOT Schlesser...!

32
00:03:11.883 --> 00:03:12.967
It's a... taxi...

33
00:03:18.883 --> 00:03:21.383
I didn't catch his number...

34
00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:33.383
17 min, 25 sec!

35
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.967
As always, the passengers throw up
after, never during the ride...

36
00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:40.800
Are you alright, honey?

37
00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:42.967
Who's the patient?

38
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.467
She is! Her waters broke!

39
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.300
Allow me.

40
00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.050
But you're giving birth here!

41
00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:53.550
What did you think?
I ain't knitting!

42
00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.050
Fetch me my gear!
No time to lose, we'll do it right here!

43
00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.716
Hey doc, I'm sorry but I gotta run!
Plus my seats are brand-new...

44
00:03:57.717 --> 00:03:59.799
...can't you just do it in the road?

45
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.883
Sir! Her waters broke!

46
00:04:01.967 --> 00:04:03.717
"Her garters broke...?"

47
00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:05.550
Push!

48
00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:10.467
Breathe! Breathe!
Now push! Push!

49
00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:18.133
Oh hi Lily, what's up?

50
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.467
The family dinner, remember?
With MY folks? You're half an hour late!

51
00:04:21.675 --> 00:04:23.217
I'll be there ASAP!

52
00:04:23.342 --> 00:04:26.758
Daniel, after 6 months I found the
courage to show you my dad...

53
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.632
And now that he's expecting you,
you're taking a road trip?

54
00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:31.799
But this is a super-big emergency!
It's top-octane!

55
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.383
What do you consider my folks then?
Diesel?

56
00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:36.050
Oh Lily, come on!

57
00:04:36.217 --> 00:04:40.717
Mom's so edgy that she dropped the roastbeef, dad's
pacing the floor... but hey, take your time!

58
00:04:40.758 --> 00:04:43.967
Lily, sorry but I can't come any faster.
I'm stuck tight here!

59
00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:50.217
What do you mean, "stuck"?
Who's that yelling?

60
00:04:50.425 --> 00:04:52.217
Err... it's... it's a woman...

61
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.882
Thanks, I recognize a woman
even if she sounds like a donkey!

62
00:04:54.883 --> 00:04:56.300
What are you doing exactly, Daniel?

63
00:04:56.383 --> 00:05:00.467
Nothing, I'm just watching here!
It's not what you think! You hear me?

64
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.217
I can hear that bitch alright!

65
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.008
Tell me, is it someone I know?

66
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.800
No! And anyway, I don't know her either!
I swear I've never seen her before!

67
00:05:08.883 --> 00:05:12.300
Oh, yes I feel it now...!
I CAN FEEL IT...!

68
00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:15.883
Hey, are you fucking with me?

69
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.925
You're banging some slut in your taxi
when I want you to meet my parents?

70
00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:24.382
Not at all! There's this fat woman,
yelling because her garters broke...

71
00:05:24.383 --> 00:05:26.424
...and her husband is holding her...!

72
00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:29.467
What, her husband, too?
A threesome in a car?

73
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.883
Oh, dear...! Can someone please explain
to her because I don't think I can...

74
00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:36.550
You here!
This is your fault so give it your best!

75
00:05:36.717 --> 00:05:40.133
Hello m'am, I'm the husband...
...and it's just wonderful...

76
00:05:40.217 --> 00:05:41.300
Come on, push!

77
00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:42.133
Listen, Lily...!

78
00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:44.550
Give me his number Daniel,
I'll forward it to the morgue...!

79
00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:49.299
He's shaken 'cause he's dropped the big
pin, do you want to talk to the doctor?

80
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.633
What, there's a doctor, too?

81
00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.300
Lily, I swear it's the truth!

82
00:05:53.383 --> 00:05:54.467
There...!

83
00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:56.633
- Oh, the baby's coming out!
- Push!

84
00:05:58.217 --> 00:06:00.382
It's a baby.
I swear it's a baby, Lily!

85
00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:01.300
Baby?

86
00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:05.050
Well yes, I can see the head!
At least I think it's a head...!

87
00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:06.300
You made a baby in my back?

88
00:06:06.383 --> 00:06:07.383
Of course not!

89
00:06:07.384 --> 00:06:13.800
He doesn't look at all like me, I swear!
He's as wrinkly as an old garden gnome!

90
00:06:13.883 --> 00:06:14.883
There...

91
00:06:14.884 --> 00:06:16.883
Oh, it's wonderful...!

92
00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:20.050
- You're getting me confused here...
- Just listen for a second!

93
00:06:20.217 --> 00:06:22.799
This woman was ready to have her baby boy,
but instead of giving birth IN the clinic...

94
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.883
...she had him IN FRONT
of the clinic, in MY taxi!

95
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.883
And now she's ruined my back seat!

96
00:06:29.883 --> 00:06:32.217
Hey, don't hit that poor kid,
what's he done to you!

97
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.717
Finally, we'll be able to talk!

98
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.383
It's marvellous!

99
00:06:36.217 --> 00:06:39.216
Next time you're at a childbirth,
I hope it'll be mine!

100
00:06:39.217 --> 00:06:43.716
No problem Lily, I can sit here and wait
if you like. This clinic looks just fine.

101
00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:45.133
You have 10 minutes to get over here!

102
00:06:46.717 --> 00:06:51.633
You're done, no twins for today?
Can we wrap up, doc? I really gotta run!

103
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.383
Ah there you are, hon!
What's wrong, a problem with your friend?

104
00:06:56.467 --> 00:07:01.132
It's nothing, an emergency at the hospital.
A difficult childbirth.

105
00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:06.300
I understand. Saving lives all day
like that... It deserves respect!

106
00:07:12.883 --> 00:07:16.217
I don't know what to say.
You were just awesome!

107
00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:17.800
I know!

108
00:07:17.883 --> 00:07:21.717
I hope you won't lose your license
after taking all those risks...

109
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.633
Don't worry sir,
I don't have a license!

110
00:07:27.883 --> 00:07:32.300
I am quite pleased...
actually moved, even...

111
00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:36.133
to hand you your... first...

112
00:07:36.717 --> 00:07:39.633
driver's... license!

113
00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:42.050
- Are you sure?
- Oh yeah, absolutely!

114
00:07:42.883 --> 00:07:45.050
But I feel like I'm
twisting your arm here...

115
00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:48.216
Oh no, there can be no doubt about it!
It was very, very good!

116
00:07:48.217 --> 00:07:51.549
I know it's my 27th attempt
but that shouldn't be a reason...!

117
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.633
Oh no no no... you know, your 100th
attempt would still be the same!

118
00:07:54.967 --> 00:07:57.133
You're ready... really ready.

119
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.133
Ok, I accept.

120
00:08:00.217 --> 00:08:01.550
That's VERY good.

121
00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:02.966
I'll just back out, then.

122
00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:04.717
NOOO!!!

123
00:08:05.467 --> 00:08:09.050
Leave it!
No touching!! Leave it!

124
00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:10.800
I'll do it! I'll sort it out!

125
00:08:10.883 --> 00:08:13.217
Exactly! We'll sort it out!

126
00:08:14.717 --> 00:08:16.717
Thanks for trusting me...
So I got my license, yes or no?

127
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.467
Oh yes... yesyesyes you do!

128
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.883
But don't go to extremes, ok?
You have to take it slowly, see?

129
00:08:23.217 --> 00:08:29.550
That license, you're HOLDING it.
And now you're gonna WALK home, see?

130
00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:33.800
I see. Ok, I'll take it.
I'll call tomorrow in case you regret it.

131
00:08:33.883 --> 00:08:37.800
Oh no you won't! I'm not here tomorrow...
will ever be, actually.

132
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.383
I've asked for a transfer,
I'm moving to Paris!

133
00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:44.633
Oh I see...
So this is a leaving present?

134
00:08:44.717 --> 00:08:47.133
You're still my most assiduous pupil!

135
00:08:47.842 --> 00:08:52.133
Yeah, right... "assiduous"!

136
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.217
Car Weekly, please.

137
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.175
No no, that's ok.
It's my pleasure!

138
00:09:11.342 --> 00:09:13.425
Mom, he's here! Mom!

139
00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:15.675
Oh...? Yes!
Yes, of course! Let's eat!

140
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.633
I'm sorry Lily, it won't happen again.

141
00:09:30.717 --> 00:09:34.967
If you screw up there won't be a next time!
My dad won't give you a second chance.

142
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.342
Oh, come on.
I'm sure he's nice deep down inside.

143
00:09:39.383 --> 00:09:42.133
How else could he have made a daughter
with such beautiful blue eyes!

144
00:09:42.383 --> 00:09:44.466
Go on, keep smirking...
You just better be careful!

145
00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:48.842
Don't worry, It'll be fine. I love him
already so why shouldn't he like me?

146
00:09:48.883 --> 00:09:50.550
- Hey... I hope he's not a cop?
- No!

147
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:55.717
Well there's no problem, then!
Ain't nothing worse than a cop!

148
00:09:59.633 --> 00:10:03.133
Dad? I'd like you to meet
my boyfriend, Daniel.

149
00:10:08.717 --> 00:10:10.883
So you're a doctor?

150
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.300
Go on... and good luck!

151
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.966
So pleased to meet you!
Lily told me so much... only nice things!

152
00:10:21.967 --> 00:10:25.300
Is your hearing impaired or
you don't like to answer questions?

153
00:10:28.425 --> 00:10:31.717
I'm not a physician...
An apprentice! I'm an apprentice, sir!

154
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.967
What year?

155
00:10:33.717 --> 00:10:37.217
1st year... I mean,
I'm just about to change into 2nd!

156
00:10:37.342 --> 00:10:39.008
2nd year?

157
00:10:39.217 --> 00:10:41.217
- You don't look so young, though.
- Edmond!

158
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.466
What, "Edmond"?
I'm just inspecting a new recruit here!

159
00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:46.467
Answer me!

160
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.216
You're right sir, I'm not young anymore
because I've worked a lot of jobs...

161
00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:54.383
...to feed my family
and pay for my licens... studies.

162
00:10:54.467 --> 00:10:57.967
I started when I was 12 so of course
it made me age faster...

163
00:10:58.133 --> 00:10:59.675
What jobs?

164
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.050
Right now I'm driving a tax... ambulance!
An ambulance!

165
00:11:03.217 --> 00:11:05.467
That's why I was late,
I got delayed at the clinic!

166
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.716
But that's ok, it keeps me on the edge.
An eye on the road, an eye on the patient!

167
00:11:10.717 --> 00:11:13.800
Doing 2 things at once, isn't that
the surest way to fail them both?

168
00:11:14.717 --> 00:11:19.550
Excuse me, sir, but I have to disagree.
Indeed, just look at yourself!

169
00:11:19.967 --> 00:11:21.717
Oh? What do you mean?

170
00:11:21.883 --> 00:11:24.467
I can see a lot of decorations there...

171
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.967
...proving you've had a successful career.

172
00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:33.050
And I see this young women... pretty,
intelligent and very well-educated.

173
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.633
This clearly proves that you successfully
managed to do 2 things at once.

174
00:11:40.133 --> 00:11:43.717
I drove an ambulance, too.
It was in '59, in Algeria.

175
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.050
An eye on the road,
an eye on the machine gun!

176
00:11:46.217 --> 00:11:50.467
We'll see to the wounded later...
...if they're still alive!

177
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.466
Edmond? My roast beef may be dead,
but it still needs treatment!

178
00:11:54.467 --> 00:11:57.467
Affirmative! I'm starving! Forward!

179
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.050
The worst is still ahead of you:
Paying attention to 3 hours of war stories!

180
00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:05.883
Don't worry, I'm shifting to neutral gear.
I'll just be gently coasting along!

181
00:12:10.967 --> 00:12:11.883
I hope I didn't hurt you?

182
00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:12.967
Not at all.

183
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.133
Oh good, because I thought I heard
your hip crack and... OUCH!

184
00:12:17.717 --> 00:12:18.633
Guess it was MY hip then!

185
00:12:18.634 --> 00:12:20.467
Sorry Émilien. You want 5 minutes?

186
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.633
No no, I'm ok... doing great!

187
00:12:22.967 --> 00:12:27.050
I just took a bad posture because
I was afraid to hurt you... but it'll pass.

188
00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:29.217
Actually it's past already,
I'm just fine!

189
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:35.133
I would've massaged it for you...
but if you tell me you're fine... great!

190
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.967
I'm fine on the surface, yes...

191
00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:42.133
but deep down, there's still
a little pain, some stiffness...

192
00:12:42.217 --> 00:12:45.633
So maybe a little massage...
just a small one!

193
00:12:47.217 --> 00:12:50.717
OK, guys, we'll finish today with
a little fight for 5 minutes...

194
00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:53.133
Bow!

195
00:12:53.134 --> 00:12:54.217
Would you like someone at your level?

196
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.300
Oh no, I'll be ok.

197
00:12:55.301 --> 00:12:59.050
- Fight!
- But I really don't want to hurt you...

198
00:12:59.133 --> 00:13:01.717
I'm really touched by
your concern, Émilien.

199
00:13:08.383 --> 00:13:10.632
So you want a piece of me?

200
00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:14.717
I'm warning you. I started at the age of 4.
I'm going to teach you a thing or two!

201
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.967
That's unfair! Your smile could melt a
radiator, how am I supposed to concentrate?

202
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.633
A guy in the street wouldn't smile at you.
Seriously, it's perturbing!

203
00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:42.550
Ok listen up, you sumos!

204
00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:46.633
Red alert!
We're meeting with the chief in 5 minutes!

205
00:13:48.717 --> 00:13:51.299
What's wrong Émilien?
Did you lose your lenses?

206
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.633
Yeah, but I can see you well enough
to kick your ass so FUCK OFF!

207
00:13:56.383 --> 00:13:58.883
You know, I'm just trying to help!

208
00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:02.217
Tell me, you done a lot of judo?

209
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.883
Nah, only a couple of times.
It's not my kind of sport.

210
00:14:06.633 --> 00:14:08.216
What is your kind of sport then?

211
00:14:08.217 --> 00:14:10.300
Karate. It's far more effective!

212
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.383
Mine's ping pong... maybe not as good to
fight, but hey, the spirit is the same:

213
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.717
Spirit of Rising Sun!

214
00:14:18.883 --> 00:14:20.717
Con-nichon-aah!

215
00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:26.967
See, it's easy. "Con"...
"consummate idiot" like Emilien!

216
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800
Thank you...

217
00:14:28.883 --> 00:14:30.966
Then, "nichon" like -
("nichon" = "boob")

218
00:14:30.967 --> 00:14:34.716
I'm not saying this for you, Petra. I know
you have... uh, it's just an example!

219
00:14:34.717 --> 00:14:39.467
And "a" as in "aaaah"!
Con-nichon-aah!

220
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.967
Now, you.
Con-nichon-a!

221
00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:46.467
Not bad.

222
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.799
What's it mean, exactly?

223
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.633
That's "hello" in Japanese.

224
00:14:49.717 --> 00:14:54.882
Remember that, because today
we're welcoming in Marseille

225
00:14:54.883 --> 00:14:58.216
the Japanese Minister of Defence.

226
00:14:58.217 --> 00:15:01.633
Mr Tefu... Temuchila...

227
00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:08.216
Mr Tef... Tejus.. let's just call him the
Nip! The nip's flying directly from Tokyo.

228
00:15:08.217 --> 00:15:14.217
And before the Franco-Japanese summit
the day after Bastille Day in Paris

229
00:15:14.633 --> 00:15:17.967
...he's visiting our charming town.
You know why?

230
00:15:18.383 --> 00:15:19.633
The climate?

231
00:15:19.967 --> 00:15:21.217
The sights?

232
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.217
Sure, the sights...

233
00:15:22.133 --> 00:15:23.133
The food?

234
00:15:23.383 --> 00:15:24.632
The pastis?

235
00:15:24.633 --> 00:15:26.133
The soccer match on Saturday!

236
00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.633
What a big bunch of nerds!

237
00:15:29.133 --> 00:15:31.967
To visit our anti-gang training base!

238
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.967
The Japs have a problem with their local
mob, the jacuzzis... Yakuza.

239
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:46.967
Who are growing bigger every day,
even kidnapping members of the government!

240
00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:52.383
The Defense Minister has visited
England, Germany and now... France.

241
00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:54.467
Let's get one thing clear:

242
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:58.633
The Krauts and the Limeys
must not win the contract!

243
00:15:58.883 --> 00:16:02.383
We whipped their ass during the last
Soccer World Cup, let's keep the title!

244
00:16:03.217 --> 00:16:06.550
So I've planned
a detailed operation,

245
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.800
that I'll now present.

246
00:16:08.883 --> 00:16:11.217
I've baptised it...

247
00:16:11.467 --> 00:16:12.883
Operation...

248
00:16:13.383 --> 00:16:14.883
...Ninja!

249
00:16:20.217 --> 00:16:22.383
We're almost through,
he's out of ammo!

250
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.967
When suddenly... no more ammo!

251
00:16:25.133 --> 00:16:27.800
Guess that's only natural
after all that shooting...

252
00:16:27.883 --> 00:16:29.300
Yeah, only natural.

253
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.800
I then I turn to Raymond.
Here he is.

254
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.217
I shake him!

255
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.467
"Raymond, your ammo!" I say.
No answer!

256
00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.467
I shake him again!
Then...

257
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.049
he falls sideways. Dead!

258
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.883
That's terrible!

259
00:16:50.967 --> 00:16:52.633
My whole unit is wiped out!

260
00:16:52.717 --> 00:16:55.383
I am still standing.
Alone. The car's on fire...

261
00:16:55.467 --> 00:16:59.550
...the radio's gone...
My flask is half-empty!

262
00:16:59.717 --> 00:17:01.967
Oh no, that's terrible!
So, what did you do?

263
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.216
Well I prayed!

264
00:17:03.217 --> 00:17:04.299
And rightly so, Edmond!

265
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.467
First because it was all I could do.
Second, because only a miracle'd save me!

266
00:17:09.967 --> 00:17:11.633
A miracle! We're saved!

267
00:17:11.717 --> 00:17:16.049
Oh no! Now what? Get that, hon,
can't you see I'm in battle!

268
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.800
Edmond, it's the red phone!

269
00:17:19.967 --> 00:17:22.633
The red phone?
Excuse me.

270
00:17:25.883 --> 00:17:27.550
General Bertineau speaking.

271
00:17:27.967 --> 00:17:30.800
It's you Bertrand?
Why are you calling on the red phone?

272
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.883
Well done, Daniel.
You'll get dessert!

273
00:17:34.633 --> 00:17:37.633
My god! I completely forgot!

274
00:17:37.967 --> 00:17:40.717
No problem. I'll be there!

275
00:17:41.008 --> 00:17:42.050
It's a catastrophy.

276
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.633
We'll save you some coffee!

277
00:17:43.717 --> 00:17:45.050
I'll be back in 1 hour!

278
00:17:45.717 --> 00:17:47.758
I want you. Right now.

279
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.633
Give me 20 seconds, ok?

280
00:17:49.717 --> 00:17:51.050
To the airport, and fast!

281
00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.967
Won't be easy!

282
00:18:02.217 --> 00:18:03.717
It's a catastrophy.

283
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.383
Dad!

284
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.883
Dad! You OK? You're hurt?

285
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:15.258
It's a catastrophy.

286
00:18:18.883 --> 00:18:21.632
I'm afraid your car'll be kinda slow now!

287
00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:25.550
I must be at the airport in 15 minutes
to greet Japan's Defense Minister.

288
00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:26.966
It's a catastrophy.

289
00:18:26.967 --> 00:18:29.550
If you want I'll get you there in time.

290
00:18:29.633 --> 00:18:31.300
In 15 minutes? Impossible.

291
00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:35.925
I can do it, sir!

292
00:18:59.258 --> 00:19:01.133
Fasten your seatbelt, dad.
Please.

293
00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:04.217
That's your ambulance?

294
00:19:04.342 --> 00:19:06.217
No sir, it's a taxi.

295
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.633
My brother loaned it to me.

296
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.050
Can you save me some dessert?

297
00:19:12.133 --> 00:19:14.133
I'm saving you two...

298
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.467
Maybe we should get going now!

299
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.550
And here we go!

300
00:19:56.008 --> 00:20:01.092
Don't worry, we're crawling 'cause
of these tires but they'll soon warm up!

301
00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:02.967
Yeah but don't overheat, son!

302
00:20:33.717 --> 00:20:37.799
Now look, kid.
This is the new Cortex 500.

303
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.467
It's the Rolls Royce of speed traps!

304
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.300
You turn it on in the back,
the read out is immediate at the front!

305
00:20:47.967 --> 00:20:50.050
Then, you go to the roadside.

306
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.217
You put your arm out ever so slightly...

307
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.383
But I think you better get
trained on the old model first.

308
00:21:07.383 --> 00:21:08.800
Are we already on the highway?

309
00:21:08.883 --> 00:21:11.132
No... but don't worry,
I can finally put the hammer down!

310
00:21:11.133 --> 00:21:12.967
No wonder you work in the emergency room!

311
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.550
It's a catastrophy.

312
00:21:25.092 --> 00:21:26.508
Chief! We got a bite!

313
00:21:26.967 --> 00:21:28.592
Shit, that's a big one!

314
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.425
306?

315
00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:37.592
I think it was rather a 406 model.
And not from a regular factory!

316
00:21:37.633 --> 00:21:40.883
I mean 306 km/h, you moron!
Warn the bikers!

317
00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:42.133
Yes?

318
00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:45.382
A white taxi at 306 km/t, I repeat...

319
00:21:45.383 --> 00:21:48.383
- ...306 km/h, 306!
- That's it, 306...

320
00:21:48.467 --> 00:21:50.300
OK, we'll get him!

321
00:21:54.258 --> 00:21:55.883
Are you OK, sir?

322
00:22:02.133 --> 00:22:03.799
There! It's him!
He's landing!

323
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.050
I must get there first to greet him!

324
00:22:05.133 --> 00:22:06.800
Let's change tactics, then!

325
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.550
Where are you going?
This isn't the road!

326
00:22:12.592 --> 00:22:14.217
Don't worry, it's a short cut!

327
00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:24.467
Hold on!

328
00:22:44.383 --> 00:22:47.050
I have a UFO on runway 1!

329
00:22:47.383 --> 00:22:49.633
"Yield to aircraft."

330
00:22:51.133 --> 00:22:55.882
We have just landed at Marignal.
Outside temperature: 35 degrees.

331
00:22:55.883 --> 00:23:00.050
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and thank you for flying with us!

332
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.633
Excuse me, Chief, there's a taxi's coming.

333
00:23:24.717 --> 00:23:29.217
What? Can't hear a thing
with all that noise!

334
00:23:29.467 --> 00:23:32.383
I repeat: Taxi inbound.

335
00:23:32.467 --> 00:23:35.467
But I never ordered a taxi.
Did you, Émilien?

336
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.967
No, but I know this one!

337
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.633
14 minutes 30!

338
00:23:51.633 --> 00:23:52.967
That's great.

339
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.300
Bertineau, why the taxi?

340
00:24:01.383 --> 00:24:04.217
We lost a vehicle, sir.
This young man quasi saved my life.

341
00:24:15.633 --> 00:24:17.717
Con-nichon-aah!

342
00:24:19.633 --> 00:24:20.883
Hello!

343
00:24:20.967 --> 00:24:21.717
What'd he say?

344
00:24:22.133 --> 00:24:23.133
Same as you, chief!

345
00:24:23.217 --> 00:24:24.467
Oh jeez...!

346
00:24:39.217 --> 00:24:43.550
Err.. Me, Gibert. Me protect you
during your vacat... err, stay.

347
00:24:43.633 --> 00:24:47.217
This is our own Minister.
Say hi... that's him...

348
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.133
Dear Minister!
What a pleasure to meet you...

349
00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:57.882
I'm honored to welcome you here.

350
00:24:57.883 --> 00:25:02.217
I'm a member of your security team.

351
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.050
We wish you a nice stay.

352
00:25:05.133 --> 00:25:06.717
You speak Japanese very well!

353
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.300
A little.
If I can help in any way, just ask.

354
00:25:11.383 --> 00:25:13.383
Pleased to meet you.

355
00:25:18.217 --> 00:25:21.300
Only the blonde girl speaks Japanese.

356
00:25:23.883 --> 00:25:26.133
I copy. Go back to base.

357
00:25:40.633 --> 00:25:44.050
Allow us to offer you a cocktail!
This way, please.

358
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:48.633
Petra, you should've told me that you speak
Japanese! Now I feel like an idiot!

359
00:25:48.717 --> 00:25:51.133
But it's written on my file!
Right below my measurements...

360
00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:53.633
Guess I never read that far, then...

361
00:25:54.967 --> 00:25:57.467
Please do me a favor, son.

362
00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.800
See that taxi over there?

363
00:25:58.883 --> 00:26:00.050
Sure I do!

364
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.050
Oh, I'd love to give you a ride, honey,
but I'm busy. Maybe next time?

365
00:26:18.717 --> 00:26:20.216
Always in the right place, eh?

366
00:26:20.217 --> 00:26:22.133
Oh stop it. Know who that guy was?

367
00:26:22.217 --> 00:26:24.882
Sure! General Bertineau,
Commander of the Med. Basin...

368
00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:26.717
- ...and Lily's dad!
- No shit!

369
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.883
- I swear! I was there for lunch.
- That's unbelievable!

370
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.133
Just my luck... you know
that I can't stand the army!

371
00:26:32.217 --> 00:26:34.049
Well you couldn't stand
cops either, but now...

372
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:37.217
...I still can't stand them!
I can stand you, that's all!

373
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.633
Anyway, don't know what you're
worrying about. He seems to like you...

374
00:26:39.717 --> 00:26:43.217
he even asked me to go get
you for the cocktail!

375
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.133
A cocktail... with half cops, half soldiers?
It's not a cocktail, it's a nightmare!

376
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.800
Guess you'd prefer half mechanics,
half gas station attendants? Oh, come on.

377
00:26:51.967 --> 00:26:54.217
You know, the small talk
is the same everywhere:

378
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.717
Cars, sports and chicks!
You'll fit in fine.

379
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.633
Except I'll feel ashamed to be there!

380
00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:02.883
Listen... if Bertineau is Lily's father...

381
00:27:02.967 --> 00:27:06.133
...he might end up as
Daniel's father-in-law, right?

382
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.050
What will Daniel's father-in law
think if you say no?

383
00:27:11.633 --> 00:27:13.050
One drink, no more.

384
00:27:24.133 --> 00:27:26.300
- "Martini"?
- Yeah, Martine, like my sister!

385
00:27:26.383 --> 00:27:30.050
Alright, one last for the road...
You can't get any worse, anyway!

386
00:27:30.133 --> 00:27:31.300
Thanks!

387
00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:36.132
Sure, the "gâteau" is good, it's locally
made. Right next to the police station.

388
00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:36.967
Gibert...

389
00:27:37.883 --> 00:27:41.133
Excuse me. Just empty it,
I'll fetch you another one!

390
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.467
Listen Gibert, don't get him too stewed,
he still needs to sign the contract!

391
00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:50.299
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
I'm just softening him up a bit...

392
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.717
...he's nearly done, now!

393
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.632
But is your plan "done"?

394
00:27:53.633 --> 00:27:58.632
Sir, it's hearsed and rehearsed to death!

395
00:27:58.633 --> 00:28:01.717
It's fine-tuned... to the second.

396
00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:09.800
My daughter told me a lot about you,
but you're not what I had imagined...

397
00:28:09.883 --> 00:28:15.467
No offense meant, but for a bright
2nd-year medical student...

398
00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.800
...I expected you to be a bit more...

399
00:28:18.883 --> 00:28:19.633
Pimply?

400
00:28:19.717 --> 00:28:23.383
"Pimply", yes... and a slower driver!

401
00:28:23.467 --> 00:28:27.133
Yes, he's definitely the
"fastest" doctor I know!

402
00:28:27.383 --> 00:28:32.382
Anyway, I'm very grateful indeed.
I owe you... a military debt!

403
00:28:32.383 --> 00:28:36.300
Ask me for anything, except for
the hand of my daughter, of course!

404
00:28:36.717 --> 00:28:40.716
Of course not...!
But I can't think of anything else.

405
00:28:40.717 --> 00:28:43.800
My offer is valid for 1 year,
parts and labor!

406
00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:46.967
Excuse me...

407
00:28:47.383 --> 00:28:48.383
Go ahead.

408
00:28:48.717 --> 00:28:51.550
Émilien, start Operation Ninja.

409
00:28:51.717 --> 00:28:53.633
Get in position. Petra,
keep an eye on him!

410
00:28:54.633 --> 00:28:55.716
Why'd he say that?

411
00:28:55.717 --> 00:28:57.799
I didn't know you had
plenty of friends with the cops?

412
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.050
Friends, friends... yeah one, maybe.

413
00:29:00.133 --> 00:29:03.800
Good! That's very rare.
Most kids today are anti-cops,

414
00:29:03.883 --> 00:29:08.550
anti-army, anti-everything!
They want to kill the father figure.

415
00:29:08.633 --> 00:29:11.467
Sir, I'm sorry but
my patients are waiting.

416
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:16.550
Wait! Just 5 more minutes.
You'll find this very interesting.

417
00:29:37.383 --> 00:29:39.466
They'll try to sell a car to the JAPS?

418
00:29:39.467 --> 00:29:41.217
"Impossible" is not a French word!

419
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.383
Dear friends, I give you... the "Cobra"!

420
00:29:43.467 --> 00:29:47.967
Specially designed to protect
visiting dignitaries.

421
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.049
Titanium bodywork.

422
00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:54.132
Multiple side panels,
that can resist any bullet!

423
00:29:54.133 --> 00:29:56.717
Missile detectors, front and back!

424
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.216
And the coating: Stealth!

425
00:29:59.217 --> 00:30:03.383
Four solid tires! It's permanently linked
to the Atlas satellite...

426
00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:07.383
and if need be, can be piloted...
from our HQ!

427
00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:10.467
Now for the engine...

428
00:30:12.133 --> 00:30:13.383
Ninja!

429
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.217
- Nice noise! It sings, for a V12.
- V12 engine, twin turbos. Voice-activated!

430
00:30:23.467 --> 00:30:26.383
Top speed: 320 km/h!

431
00:30:26.467 --> 00:30:30.550
Range: 900 km.
Paris-Marseille.

432
00:30:30.633 --> 00:30:34.549
2 airbags in the front, 2 in the back,
4 at the sides...

433
00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:37.967
a total of 8 for maximum protection.

434
00:30:39.383 --> 00:30:43.217
Ladies and gentlemen,
this car is like France:

435
00:30:43.883 --> 00:30:45.467
It's indestructible!

436
00:30:48.633 --> 00:30:52.799
Err, that's just 'cause we set
the airbags to "ultra-sensitive"...

437
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.133
but when it's set to "normal",
well, it's normal!

438
00:30:58.383 --> 00:30:59.883
Did you see the balloons?

439
00:31:00.217 --> 00:31:02.383
Note that it would be very useful
to stop thieves!

440
00:31:03.217 --> 00:31:06.717
Get him out! Hold on to his head.

441
00:31:07.467 --> 00:31:10.050
Tell him not to worry,
it's just a matter of fine-tuning!

442
00:31:12.967 --> 00:31:15.383
He's not worried, he needs
to go to the restrooms!

443
00:31:15.467 --> 00:31:18.050
- Bertrand, go with him.
- Yes, sir.

444
00:31:20.133 --> 00:31:23.217
We're fine, sir. Once we deflate
the airbags, it'll be as good as new.

445
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.217
Can you reinflate him, too?
Who's gonna drive your "Cobra", now?

446
00:31:29.883 --> 00:31:34.217
Sir, I have a young civilian driver.
He's very good, fast and precise.

447
00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.717
I'll vouch for him.

448
00:31:36.217 --> 00:31:37.217
Oh no...

449
00:31:38.633 --> 00:31:39.467
Banco!

450
00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:49.050
Before your tour of the town I'll show
you our latest computing innovation.

451
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.717
Gimme that!

452
00:31:58.383 --> 00:31:59.633
Here, wear this.

453
00:31:59.967 --> 00:32:01.132
But it'll cramp my style!

454
00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:02.967
Don't worry, this baby's
so easy to drive...

455
00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:06.467
even a cretin wearing mitts could do it!
Take him away, lads!

456
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.967
No no, that's OK.

457
00:32:12.217 --> 00:32:13.383
See? I told you!

458
00:32:13.467 --> 00:32:15.300
Never mind, it's on the back,
nobody will see it.

459
00:32:15.301 --> 00:32:17.133
Go on now! Ninja!

460
00:32:19.633 --> 00:32:21.550
Great, but how do you stop it?

461
00:32:21.967 --> 00:32:23.633
You just have to say "nip!"

462
00:32:25.133 --> 00:32:26.550
Ninja!

463
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.967
It's easy as pie. We prepared a
demonstration... Get it? With fake attacks!

464
00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:34.216
Like a ghost train?

465
00:32:34.217 --> 00:32:37.383
Exactly like that.
We must impress the nip!

466
00:32:38.383 --> 00:32:40.050
Ninja!

467
00:32:40.217 --> 00:32:44.049
Above all, don't worry.
Just allow things to happen.

468
00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.050
If the nip...

469
00:32:45.717 --> 00:32:46.967
Ninja!

470
00:32:47.133 --> 00:32:49.632
Could you stop playing when I'm talking?

471
00:32:49.633 --> 00:32:51.716
It's not my fault if you keep saying "nip"!

472
00:32:51.717 --> 00:32:53.467
NINJA!

473
00:32:53.633 --> 00:32:55.300
- Great!
- Yeah, not bad.

474
00:32:56.717 --> 00:33:00.717
Sir, if you please, we shall now
escort you to your hotel.

475
00:33:01.633 --> 00:33:03.217
ALL ABOARD!

476
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.217
Hello!

477
00:33:08.633 --> 00:33:10.383
We're up shit creek again...

478
00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.800
Forward!

479
00:33:54.967 --> 00:33:56.300
They're here.

480
00:33:56.383 --> 00:33:58.383
On this road.
Everything is as planned.

481
00:33:58.467 --> 00:34:01.717
Very good, Katano.
Let me hear them.

482
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.550
Spring Roll, please copy.

483
00:34:10.467 --> 00:34:11.717
Spring Roll, come in!

484
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.050
Hey, Spring Roll, come in!

485
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.383
Hep Émilien, come in!

486
00:34:16.383 --> 00:34:17.550
Spring Roll, d'you hear me?

487
00:34:17.633 --> 00:34:19.050
Loud 'n' clear.

488
00:34:19.133 --> 00:34:23.800
We just left, on our way to the first trap.
Gonna take us at least 20 mins.

489
00:34:23.883 --> 00:34:27.383
OK. Guys, we got 20 mins.
Get warmed up!

490
00:34:30.467 --> 00:34:33.800
What about us?
What can we do for 20 minutes?

491
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:36.383
I don't know, do you have any ideas?

492
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:40.717
Yeah, but 20 centimeters...
err, minutes is too short!

493
00:34:40.883 --> 00:34:45.467
Oh yeah? So, we need an idea,
we could start now...

494
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.967
and finish later...

495
00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.050
Yes, with my idea that'd work fine!

496
00:34:50.133 --> 00:34:53.383
But... I too... have an idea,

497
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.050
I'm sure... you'll really like it.

498
00:34:57.133 --> 00:34:59.633
Oh yeah? Maybe it's the same one?

499
00:34:59.717 --> 00:35:01.550
That'd be marvelous!

500
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:06.383
It... it would be ideal!
Go on, you say first...

501
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:14.717
Make the most of these few
quiet moments... to...

502
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.133
...learn Japanese!

503
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.257
Aah... guess it wasn't the same idea...!

504
00:35:19.258 --> 00:35:20.300
'Fraid not!

505
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.550
He won't see much of Marseille.

506
00:35:27.342 --> 00:35:30.050
Sorry, he's suffering from jetlag.

507
00:35:31.383 --> 00:35:34.466
May I ask... why your boss
is here in Marseille?

508
00:35:34.467 --> 00:35:39.133
To sign very big contract
and see anti-gang method.

509
00:35:39.217 --> 00:35:40.799
He'll sure see that!

510
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.424
You know method?

511
00:35:42.425 --> 00:35:44.008
Sure I do!

512
00:35:44.467 --> 00:35:45.967
First, the Suspect.

513
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:50.507
He is probably guilty since he's a suspect.
If he's a foreigner, he'll be doubly suspect!

514
00:35:50.508 --> 00:35:55.550
Then there's the Guilty.
A foreign, tanned suspect... he's dead.

515
00:35:55.717 --> 00:36:00.050
If he's tanned, it means he's been
sun-bathing and does nothing all day.

516
00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:04.633
And if he doesn't work, he's a suspect!
So, he's guilty. No flaws in that logic!

517
00:36:04.717 --> 00:36:06.133
That boy, is he any good?

518
00:36:06.383 --> 00:36:10.300
Very good. He's a doctor
and a friend of my daughter's.

519
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.133
They won't tell me but I think
they've been flirting a bit.

520
00:36:14.217 --> 00:36:15.883
It's only natural, at their age.

521
00:36:15.967 --> 00:36:16.550
Quite.

522
00:36:16.717 --> 00:36:21.632
Next, to make the guilty party confess
one uses the Questioning!

523
00:36:21.633 --> 00:36:24.883
That's simple too.
You apply a trilogy... like "Star Wars"!

524
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:29.300
Episode 1: Beat 'em!
Good, healthy exercise!

525
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:34.258
Episode 2: Tax 'em!
To raise some cash for Christmas!

526
00:36:34.467 --> 00:36:37.633
Episode 3: Get drunk!
To celebrate this!

527
00:36:37.717 --> 00:36:41.967
I'm pleased to see some kids are still
respecting our values and traditions.

528
00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:44.467
He'd be a good son-in-law.

529
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.800
You think so?

530
00:36:45.883 --> 00:36:47.549
Many gangs in France?

531
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:51.717
Yeah! The most dangerous one is the "Pigs".
They have over 100'000 members!

532
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:55.467
They're easy to spot:
A whistle, wearin' blue and holdin' a beer!

533
00:36:58.467 --> 00:37:00.467
Ok, now turn left, towards the port.

534
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.717
My pleasure, chief.

535
00:37:02.217 --> 00:37:03.800
He also sounds very polite.

536
00:37:03.967 --> 00:37:06.133
Affirmative. Courteous, too.

537
00:37:06.217 --> 00:37:11.300
Oh yeah... polite to your face...
and shafting you from behind!

538
00:37:11.383 --> 00:37:15.550
Like in the souk.
A big smile as they steal your cash!

539
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.633
But don't worry, I've got my eye on him.

540
00:37:24.633 --> 00:37:26.217
May I ask question you?

541
00:37:26.342 --> 00:37:30.050
I'm only starting in the police,
but hey, try me.

542
00:37:30.133 --> 00:37:34.217
What means word that
captain uses often: "nip"?

543
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.967
Why'd he stop? Told you, gotta watch'em!

544
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.467
What's going on?

545
00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:44.842
Just a simultaneous translation problem!
Ninja!

546
00:37:48.717 --> 00:37:52.800
Cut the crap, ok? We're getting
to the meeting point in... well, now.

547
00:38:14.008 --> 00:38:15.467
Don't worry, that's normal!

548
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.967
Total red alert!

549
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.050
Oh shit...! There's a missile
looking straight at me, is that normal?

550
00:38:40.133 --> 00:38:41.967
Missile? What missile?

551
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.467
Hop!

552
00:38:46.717 --> 00:38:53.217
The Atlas real-time missile diverter.
It's unique! The Limeys won't get the ball!

553
00:38:53.342 --> 00:38:56.467
Impressive, but where is
the missile flying now?

554
00:38:56.717 --> 00:39:00.217
Don't worry. Somewhere far out at sea.

555
00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:04.383
Shit, my boat!

556
00:39:25.092 --> 00:39:27.050
And now, the climax of our show.

557
00:39:33.633 --> 00:39:34.883
Impressive!

558
00:39:37.342 --> 00:39:39.633
Very good work, Gibert.

559
00:39:39.675 --> 00:39:46.133
Thank you sir, I'm finally able to try out
all my toys at last. That's so nice!

560
00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.008
Roadhog!

561
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.342
OK son, the coast is clear.

562
00:40:02.592 --> 00:40:03.633
Ninja!

563
00:40:07.967 --> 00:40:09.467
Very impressive.

564
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:10.967
You know, you get used to it.

565
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.632
Just an average day in Marseille!

566
00:40:12.633 --> 00:40:13.633
I see.

567
00:40:26.633 --> 00:40:30.717
Your mouthing is improving,
but your accent isn't!

568
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.508
Oh...?

569
00:40:31.967 --> 00:40:33.967
Spring Roll, Spring Roll, do you copy?

570
00:40:34.383 --> 00:40:38.008
Yeah, fine. Are we there yet...
I mean, how far are you?

571
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:42.967
We completed the first attack.
Be with you in 5 min, are you ready?

572
00:40:43.217 --> 00:40:45.050
Err... yeah, yeah.

573
00:40:45.133 --> 00:40:49.633
Petra and I were checking a few things out,
everything is set now.

574
00:40:49.717 --> 00:40:54.050
Émilien, Gibert here.
Émilien, I'm counting on you!

575
00:40:54.175 --> 00:40:56.758
Oh yes you can count on me, Petra...
Err I mean...!

576
00:40:56.883 --> 00:40:58.842
You can count on Petra, chief!

577
00:40:59.092 --> 00:41:00.300
Count on Petra!

578
00:41:00.383 --> 00:41:01.717
Count on Petra, chief!

579
00:41:03.008 --> 00:41:06.550
Go! Get the Minister!

580
00:41:31.675 --> 00:41:34.008
What the fuck...?
Dammit, I told you to warm up!

581
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.300
Yeah, we're hot...

582
00:41:35.383 --> 00:41:39.300
- Gibert will kill you guys! Now go warm up!
- I'll leave you guys for a second!

583
00:41:47.467 --> 00:41:50.050
I'll go with you Petra...
you never know...

584
00:42:04.883 --> 00:42:06.800
Hey, can't you read?

585
00:42:07.342 --> 00:42:11.383
It says "green light"!
Get a move on, you fag!

586
00:42:12.383 --> 00:42:13.342
Oh shit!

587
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.050
Now turn left. I repeat, left.

588
00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.050
Yes, chief. I repeat, chief!

589
00:42:39.633 --> 00:42:41.300
The Minister says that you drive well.

590
00:42:41.383 --> 00:42:43.007
But I'm not even moving!

591
00:42:43.008 --> 00:42:48.217
It freaks me out not to hear the engine!
An engine has to speak to me!

592
00:42:54.633 --> 00:42:57.592
Are you putting in earplugs now?
Do I talk too much?

593
00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.882
Nein! This is a miniature ear transmitter.

594
00:43:01.883 --> 00:43:04.383
It's brand new! I'm on Channel 1.

595
00:43:04.717 --> 00:43:06.717
But how do we talk?

596
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.092
Émilien...
I know you French aren't used to it...

597
00:43:10.217 --> 00:43:13.800
but an order is to be obeyed,
not discussed!

598
00:43:14.008 --> 00:43:18.425
Yeah, but if you have a
problem, what do I... do...?

599
00:43:21.883 --> 00:43:23.800
How do I know if you can hear me?

600
00:43:25.383 --> 00:43:29.633
Aah... 1 bang means yes, 2 means no!

601
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.467
Do you mind if we keep chatting?

602
00:43:37.633 --> 00:43:39.258
That's good, 'cause...

603
00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:43.800
The closed door
makes it easier to talk to you.

604
00:43:47.092 --> 00:43:50.467
I don't dare to say
everything to your face.

605
00:43:53.592 --> 00:43:57.133
You eyes trouble me.
They're so...

606
00:43:58.383 --> 00:43:59.467
...so blue!

607
00:44:01.925 --> 00:44:03.883
Now what's Spring Roll up to?

608
00:44:03.967 --> 00:44:04.800
What's going on, Gibert?

609
00:44:04.883 --> 00:44:06.383
Don't worry, it's in code...

610
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.299
I just can't find the translation!

611
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:13.550
When your eyes look at me... I mean, wow!
Nobody ever looked at me like that...

612
00:44:13.633 --> 00:44:15.050
well, maybe when I had my back turned...

613
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.133
Is that part of method?

614
00:44:17.217 --> 00:44:19.883
You bet it is! That's Daniel's method!

615
00:44:21.717 --> 00:44:24.842
It's good to talk to you...
to open my heart to you.

616
00:44:26.133 --> 00:44:27.550
You don't mind too much?

617
00:44:32.925 --> 00:44:34.217
Petra?

618
00:44:36.217 --> 00:44:37.883
Should I go on, then?

619
00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:39.800
I don't get this code!

620
00:44:39.925 --> 00:44:44.633
Have you noticed that...
I'm much closer to you now?

621
00:44:47.133 --> 00:44:48.383
What do you mean, "no"?

622
00:44:53.883 --> 00:44:55.133
Ahh, that's better!

623
00:44:57.467 --> 00:45:01.717
Ok, Petra, I'll say something
you may find shocking...

624
00:45:02.592 --> 00:45:03.799
Here goes...

625
00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.633
I bet it'll be stupid...!

626
00:45:05.717 --> 00:45:09.217
Well... Petra, ever since I met you...

627
00:45:10.133 --> 00:45:10.925
I love you!

628
00:45:13.133 --> 00:45:14.466
Well done, Émilien!

629
00:45:14.467 --> 00:45:15.717
See, I told you!

630
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.717
There, I said it!

631
00:45:17.383 --> 00:45:22.967
Now put me out of my misery:
Is it mutual? So...

632
00:45:25.217 --> 00:45:28.383
1 bang: Yes, 2 means no.

633
00:45:31.383 --> 00:45:35.050
Hey Émilien, change channels to talk dirty!
Some people are working here!

634
00:45:36.717 --> 00:45:38.217
Daniel? Turn left here, son.

635
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.217
Yes, poppy!

636
00:45:49.883 --> 00:45:51.383
He's not one of us.

637
00:46:03.383 --> 00:46:05.300
That's for sure.
He's not one of us.

638
00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:27.883
Why are you stopping here?
Go on, go on! Ninja!

639
00:46:27.967 --> 00:46:30.883
Sorry to sound pessimistic,
but something smells fishy.

640
00:46:30.967 --> 00:46:35.883
"Smell fishy"? I don't smell a thing!
Do you smell something, sir?

641
00:46:38.967 --> 00:46:44.217
Isn't that strange how those trucks are parked,
exactly leaving room for a car to pass!

642
00:46:45.883 --> 00:46:50.050
No, there's no trap. I checked the map,
I'm the one who made it. No trap here!

643
00:46:50.467 --> 00:46:51.716
So move it!

644
00:46:51.717 --> 00:46:52.967
If you say so...

645
00:46:56.883 --> 00:46:58.633
I should know.

646
00:47:06.633 --> 00:47:08.800
Oh deary me, a trap...!

647
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.133
Now what's he up to?

648
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.050
On what page are we?

649
00:47:41.383 --> 00:47:44.467
But that's not on my list, that is...!

650
00:47:53.383 --> 00:47:54.717
Hats off to this one!

651
00:47:57.133 --> 00:47:58.967
And I'm glad it's not my taxi!

652
00:48:11.217 --> 00:48:14.050
Petra! Petra!

653
00:48:14.133 --> 00:48:16.966
What happened? Where's the nip?

654
00:48:16.967 --> 00:48:20.800
Well some Ninjas!... came
and the Minister went...

655
00:48:20.967 --> 00:48:23.632
What? He didn't fly away?

656
00:48:23.633 --> 00:48:28.217
Yes he did! And at that speed
he must be on his way to Mars!

657
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.550
Just ask the Atlas satellite.
It must've spotted him!

658
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.967
RED ALERT!!!

659
00:48:38.467 --> 00:48:39.717
Stop! Police!

660
00:49:34.133 --> 00:49:35.467
Shit!

661
00:50:10.967 --> 00:50:12.967
Complex town, huh?

662
00:50:13.133 --> 00:50:16.217
There are only small streets!
The jail cells aren't bigger, either!

663
00:50:16.717 --> 00:50:21.467
Lie down flat there!
I'm a crack shot so no tricks!

664
00:50:24.967 --> 00:50:27.299
Me warn you: Me shoot!

665
00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.550
Spread out!

666
00:50:45.467 --> 00:50:48.800
So that's how you wanna play it?
All right!

667
00:50:57.717 --> 00:51:01.883
Awww, now where are they?
They didn't fly away as well, did they?

668
00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:04.050
Where's Émilien?
Émilien?

669
00:51:05.133 --> 00:51:05.883
Émilien!

670
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:09.050
The way I know him,
he's probably near the garbage.

671
00:51:09.883 --> 00:51:14.133
Chief, I was this close to getting 'em,
but I was outnumbered!

672
00:51:14.217 --> 00:51:15.467
Émilien, they took the Minister!

673
00:51:15.717 --> 00:51:16.383
Which one?

674
00:51:16.467 --> 00:51:19.883
The nip, of course! Ours is useless...
It's a disaster!

675
00:51:19.967 --> 00:51:22.550
Yeah, and they got Petra, too.

676
00:51:22.633 --> 00:51:27.383
Oh...? Good!
She speaks Japanese, he'll be less alone.

677
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:59.382
Lily, I swear I'm on my way.
Your dad made me stay!

678
00:51:59.383 --> 00:52:03.383
But it's been 2 hours, not 20 seconds!
I'm hot all over now!

679
00:52:03.883 --> 00:52:05.883
- All over?
- Yeah, all over!

680
00:52:06.967 --> 00:52:09.300
I'm gonna catch fire soon...!

681
00:52:09.383 --> 00:52:12.967
Listen Lily, just watch
a documentary, it'll calm you!

682
00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.217
Gimme 5 minutes.

683
00:52:14.633 --> 00:52:16.299
Can't hold that long...

684
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.633
4 minutes then! Émilien!

685
00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.217
It's all my fault. Shouldn't have
let her go to the john alone!

686
00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.467
You should gone with her...!

687
00:52:35.633 --> 00:52:38.800
I thought of that! I did. But...

688
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:44.217
Finished scratching about yet?
It's been an hour, d'you find anything?

689
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:48.216
There were indeed cars here.
3 of them.

690
00:52:48.217 --> 00:52:52.133
You read Sherlock Holmes to deduce that?

691
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:55.716
Don't you have any clues
to get us started?

692
00:52:55.717 --> 00:53:01.300
We'll analyze the tire samples at the lab.
I'm sure that laser analysis will...

693
00:53:01.383 --> 00:53:04.467
Yeah and they'll have time to
SWIM back to Tokyo! Geez...

694
00:53:09.467 --> 00:53:15.299
Thanks for everything, but I need my taxi, now!
What d'you want me to do with your cabriolet?

695
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:19.217
Daniel, we're in deep shit!
These clowns are shaving the road!

696
00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.383
Couldn't you help us find a clue?

697
00:53:21.467 --> 00:53:25.800
Émilien, Lily's on fire.
She might burn herself!

698
00:53:25.883 --> 00:53:29.383
But they got my girl!
Isn't that worth 2 minutes of your time?

699
00:53:29.467 --> 00:53:32.550
Just take a look,
after that I'll handle it.

700
00:53:38.383 --> 00:53:40.383
From below, I saw 3 black Mitsubishis,

701
00:53:40.467 --> 00:53:43.633
not sure what model.
It was a new model.

702
00:53:45.467 --> 00:53:47.799
Their tires come straight from Japan.

703
00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.633
How'd you know?

704
00:53:48.634 --> 00:53:49.882
I smell it.

705
00:53:49.883 --> 00:53:51.049
Smells of fish?

706
00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:52.133
Meaning...?

707
00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:53.467
A restaurant?

708
00:53:53.468 --> 00:53:55.299
You got fish oil for brains?

709
00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:59.882
Restaurants and... ports!
They were at the port with brand-new tires.

710
00:53:59.883 --> 00:54:03.216
So, they were in a boat from Japan!
That's why it smells of fish!

711
00:54:03.217 --> 00:54:04.466
See, you can think!

712
00:54:04.467 --> 00:54:07.550
- Now, are they stolen cars?
- That's easy. Alain!

713
00:54:07.633 --> 00:54:08.633
I'm on it!

714
00:54:09.633 --> 00:54:12.633
OK you clowns, put your
tweezers down and go home.

715
00:54:12.717 --> 00:54:18.467
Monday morning you take a whistle, I'll
let you analyze a crossraod. Do you good.

716
00:54:20.633 --> 00:54:21.800
Jerks!

717
00:54:21.883 --> 00:54:25.050
Negative.
Nothing's been stolen from the port.

718
00:54:25.133 --> 00:54:25.800
Bingo!

719
00:54:25.883 --> 00:54:29.050
What bingo? No cars were stolen,
it means you were wrong!

720
00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:32.967
Three cars were stolen but no theft
was declared. Why?

721
00:54:33.717 --> 00:54:37.382
Because the guards knew...
Because they use the warehouse as a base!

722
00:54:37.383 --> 00:54:39.050
See, you can be smart!

723
00:54:39.717 --> 00:54:40.717
Red alert!

724
00:54:40.883 --> 00:54:44.217
C'mon, Émilien, that's my line!

725
00:54:45.217 --> 00:54:47.383
You'll explain to me on the road
'cause I don't get it...

726
00:54:51.133 --> 00:54:54.049
Lily? Yes, I'm on my way!
You still watching TV?

727
00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:59.217
No, I had to stop. There was a report about
animal sex, made me set fire to the rug!

728
00:54:59.383 --> 00:55:02.300
- Sir? It's Lily, she's worried about you.
- Gimme that.

729
00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:06.966
Tell your mom we're OK but the mission's
complicated, we need reinforcements.

730
00:55:06.967 --> 00:55:10.383
So I'm keeping your friend.
He did a great job. Good recruit.

731
00:55:10.467 --> 00:55:14.883
He'll bring me home, so you can
tell him "good night". Bye, hon!

732
00:55:15.633 --> 00:55:18.800
C'mon let's go, son!
The mission ain't over!

733
00:56:01.717 --> 00:56:04.050
Alain for Émilien,
now what's Gibert up to?

734
00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:10.467
Dunno, he's been locked in the john
for ages, making weird noises...

735
00:56:18.133 --> 00:56:18.883
Oh no...!

736
00:56:27.633 --> 00:56:28.883
What? What's up?

737
00:56:28.967 --> 00:56:32.383
Can't tell you.
It's... too horrible!

738
00:56:45.633 --> 00:56:47.717
Émilien? They won't come.

739
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.050
Are you kidding?

740
00:56:49.217 --> 00:56:54.217
I think this was their first base,
but something tells me they're gone.

741
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.133
Long gone.

742
00:57:10.633 --> 00:57:13.382
A suspect approaching. Asian male.

743
00:57:13.383 --> 00:57:16.633
Aah, see? They always return
to the scene of the crime!

744
00:57:16.717 --> 00:57:18.133
Police academy, lesson 1!

745
00:57:18.217 --> 00:57:18.800
Get in position!

746
00:57:22.717 --> 00:57:23.217
Captain?

747
00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:27.800
Suspects are approaching front door.

748
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:32.967
Perfect!
Bring 'em on!

749
00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:47.967
Hey Marco, you sure about this?

750
00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:52.217
Are you kidding?
It's the heist of the century!

751
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.717
There's a mountain of VCRs,
all boxed and awaiting delivery!

752
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:58.966
They're about to break in.

753
00:57:58.967 --> 00:57:59.967
We got 'em!

754
00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:03.217
Émilien, would you break into
your own home?

755
00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.883
Sure! Oh? Well, not always...

756
00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.800
Uh-oh!

757
00:58:11.133 --> 00:58:12.383
Chief, are you gonna...?

758
00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:17.217
Émilien, I like to stay close to my men.

759
00:58:17.633 --> 00:58:23.467
Some action won't hurt me.
Just like in the good ole days!

760
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:25.049
But that was long ago, chief...

761
00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:32.633
The MEMORIES are distant, Émilien,
but the reflexes... are still here!

762
00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:36.133
Trust me.

763
00:58:36.383 --> 00:58:37.550
You'll see.

764
00:58:44.467 --> 00:58:45.967
Marco, you sure there's no cops?

765
00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:48.800
Shit, relax, dammit! There's no one here!

766
00:58:48.883 --> 00:58:53.633
They're all watching the game.
Every cop's in front of a TV.

767
00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:57.217
Ready to attack? Wait for my signal.

768
00:59:02.633 --> 00:59:05.050
Chief, you worry me.
It's long a way down...

769
00:59:05.133 --> 00:59:08.799
It's OK, Émilien! Just tie the knot
for me, I'll do the rest.

770
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.050
I got a bad feeling...

771
00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:15.717
See?
They're all at the match, like I said!

772
00:59:19.883 --> 00:59:22.133
AND ATTACK...!

773
00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:30.967
Oh shit oh shit oh shit!

774
00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:32.133
Émilien?

775
00:59:33.133 --> 00:59:34.216
OK, chief!

776
00:59:34.217 --> 00:59:36.717
BANZAI...!

777
00:59:38.133 --> 00:59:40.633
What...?
Who's getting his throat cut...?

778
00:59:45.133 --> 00:59:45.717
Émilien...?

779
00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:49.050
I don't get it, I made
a strong knot... see?

780
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.133
Émilien!

781
00:59:52.133 --> 00:59:53.383
Maybe it's the rope...?

782
00:59:53.467 --> 00:59:55.716
That's it, you tied the wrong rope!

783
00:59:55.717 --> 00:59:56.717
Ah, I see...

784
00:59:56.967 --> 00:59:58.799
An ambulance! Quick!

785
00:59:58.800 --> 00:59:59.633
Émilien...

786
01:00:00.883 --> 01:00:04.050
Émili... AAAHHH!!!

787
01:00:17.633 --> 01:00:21.549
It's all my fault. I should never
have left her... and him... down!

788
01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:24.050
Hey, hey, enough already!

789
01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:28.217
Stop your whining, that won't
bring her back! Think instead!

790
01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.883
I'm thinking, I'm thinking! But we
haven't got a single lead to work on!

791
01:00:31.967 --> 01:00:34.216
Maybe if you ask the right questions,
you'll get the right answers!

792
01:00:34.217 --> 01:00:37.382
For instance, why didn't the Yakuza
kill the Minister at once?

793
01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:39.217
- 'Cause they need him?
- Excellent, but why?

794
01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:41.383
- Did they ask for a ransom?
- No.

795
01:00:42.133 --> 01:00:43.383
Why not kidnap him in Japan?

796
01:00:44.217 --> 01:00:46.133
But they did it here in France!

797
01:00:46.467 --> 01:00:49.967
They must have had a good reason.
Why's the Minister going to Paris, exactly?

798
01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:55.467
To watch the parade and sign contracts.
Security, trains, army, nuclear...

799
01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.300
There! Maybe they want to prevent that?

800
01:00:58.383 --> 01:01:01.132
But that makes no sense,
why would they do that?

801
01:01:01.133 --> 01:01:04.633
Your friend's right. Yuki Tsumoto
doesn't want those contracts to be signed.

802
01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:09.050
Hey, don't I know you?
Weren't you an air hostess earlier?

803
01:01:09.217 --> 01:01:14.300
I'm Yuli. I'm here to protect the Minister,
as a member of the Japanese intelligence.

804
01:01:14.467 --> 01:01:18.549
Ain't that funny! I am too...
Émilien, Police of Marseille.

805
01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.882
That's Daniel, he's...

806
01:01:19.883 --> 01:01:22.300
...in training!
I'm learning how to be stupid!

807
01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.050
Yeah, right...
Who's this "Yuki Tsumoto" guy?

808
01:01:26.133 --> 01:01:30.716
A Yakuza. He controls the north.
Very powerful and conservative.

809
01:01:30.717 --> 01:01:34.217
He doesn't want airplanes,
trains, nuclear power...

810
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.882
France is keen to sell,
so he's taking steps.

811
01:01:37.883 --> 01:01:42.050
Not only the Minister won't sign anything, but
France will never sign contracts with Japan again!

812
01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:45.717
Tsumoto sent over 2 grand
masters in hypnosis.

813
01:01:45.883 --> 01:01:50.050
They'll condition the Minister, who during
the parade will grab any weapon...

814
01:01:50.133 --> 01:01:52.550
...and start killing people at random.
Maybe even the President.

815
01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:57.882
And to protest, France will abort all diplomatic
relations with Japan... so no more contracts!

816
01:01:57.883 --> 01:01:59.217
- Exactly.
- That's crazy!

817
01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:04.049
The parade is at 11 so we have very little
time to free your friend and the Minister.

818
01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:06.300
Yeah well but I have to
ask my boss first...

819
01:02:06.383 --> 01:02:08.216
Which one, the cripple or Sleeping Beauty?

820
01:02:08.217 --> 01:02:09.050
Oh, yeah...

821
01:02:09.133 --> 01:02:12.799
Listen Émilien, both of you
want to save somebody.

822
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.331
We're in a bit of a rush, so instead
of waiting for the Administration...

823
01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:19.200
...maybe we should do it
ourselves, don't you think?

824
01:02:19.467 --> 01:02:23.800
He's right! Sorry! No nip... is
gonna beat us! So where do we start?

825
01:02:23.883 --> 01:02:26.717
First, can you localize them in Paris?

826
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.633
- Absolutely not!
- Sure! Easy as pie!

827
01:02:57.883 --> 01:03:01.133
Thanks, Joe. You saved my life!
See you soon, pal.

828
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:05.883
Got 'em! They're hiding out
in the XIVth district.

829
01:03:05.967 --> 01:03:08.216
Are you sure it's her?
Uh, I mean, them!

830
01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:12.132
3 black Mitsubishis with a blonde tied
in the back. You want me to verify?

831
01:03:12.133 --> 01:03:12.967
OK, OK...

832
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.133
Well there's not much time left.
To the airport!

833
01:03:15.217 --> 01:03:17.133
Don't hurry, there's no
plane for at least 3h!

834
01:03:19.717 --> 01:03:23.800
We can't wait. We must get to Paris ASAP.
So find a solution!

835
01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.299
GET UP! WAR IS UPON US!

836
01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.467
- To me! My men!
- It's me, Daniel!

837
01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:32.550
Oh, Daniel...!
Where are the troops?

838
01:03:32.633 --> 01:03:37.383
Wiped out! There's only us to save the day.
And you owe me, remember?

839
01:03:37.467 --> 01:03:40.050
- Affirmative!
- Well, I need your help. Now.

840
01:03:54.967 --> 01:03:57.383
Oh shit... what's taking them so long?

841
01:04:07.633 --> 01:04:09.467
Cool! No worries, buddy!

842
01:04:09.633 --> 01:04:15.050
Daniel, I hope you know what you're doing
'cause I don't trust this. Not one bit!

843
01:04:15.133 --> 01:04:16.299
Why, you got a better idea?

844
01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.133
What, right now? No, but...

845
01:04:18.217 --> 01:04:20.050
Well, then you better think! Fast!

846
01:04:42.383 --> 01:04:45.883
- Daniel, I got it! Lemme out, I can...
- Too late...!

847
01:05:06.717 --> 01:05:08.133
Are you cool, guys?

848
01:05:08.467 --> 01:05:10.966
You bet! Cool as ice!

849
01:05:10.967 --> 01:05:13.217
Just shout if there's a problem, OK?

850
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:18.382
OK, I'm shouting!
We just lost a parachute!

851
01:05:18.383 --> 01:05:21.300
That's why there's 3 of 'em!
1 or 2 always screw up!

852
01:05:21.633 --> 01:05:22.633
I see...!

853
01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:29.049
Émilien. You got your license now, right?

854
01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:29.717
Yeah, why?

855
01:05:29.718 --> 01:05:32.967
Take my place then. C'mon, move it!

856
01:05:42.133 --> 01:05:43.633
I'll try to find out where we are.

857
01:05:43.883 --> 01:05:44.883
Where am I going?

858
01:05:44.967 --> 01:05:46.300
Straight ahead!

859
01:05:46.883 --> 01:05:48.633
- Straight ahead?
- Yeah, straight ahead!

860
01:05:48.717 --> 01:05:49.633
OK, whatever you say...!

861
01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:54.383
Come on now, just relax.
Be more zen, you'll feel better!

862
01:05:57.883 --> 01:06:00.717
That feels good, you know.
Real good!

863
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.717
Oh, Lily darling! Are you OK?

864
01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.550
Who's chirping there?

865
01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:09.467
- The hostess.
- Hostess?

866
01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:11.717
Actually, she's a nurse.

867
01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:13.383
You're in a massage parlor, is that it?

868
01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:19.466
Of course not, Lily! We're in the sky! Your
dad's guiding us, Émilien is steering...

869
01:06:19.467 --> 01:06:24.633
I am fixing the parachute and the nurse
is chirping to calm our nerves, that's all!

870
01:06:24.717 --> 01:06:26.717
Daniel, what DID you smoke, exactly?!?

871
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.716
Now listen to me. Lily! I'm trying
to save Petra and a Minister's ass!

872
01:06:30.717 --> 01:06:34.883
So I'll call you again when we land!
Is that so hard to understand?

873
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.800
- Are you feeling alright, hon?
- I'm great!

874
01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:41.717
What? She never believes me!

875
01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:46.717
Try to turn left a bit.

876
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.133
Now, turn left.
I repeat, left...

877
01:07:04.467 --> 01:07:05.717
Hi there!

878
01:07:08.967 --> 01:07:11.967
Everything's OK, stay calm!
Marseille Police!

879
01:07:20.883 --> 01:07:22.550
- Do you know them?
- Yeah.

880
01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.717
Yeah... an old pupil...
Gonna WALK home, now...

881
01:07:29.633 --> 01:07:31.049
Good morning Lionel.

882
01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:34.133
- Good morning Jacques, this is Mr. Coutta...
- Hello, how do you do?

883
01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:41.717
- Are you all set, Coutta?
- The Japanese Minister is still missing.

884
01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:10.133
There, I see her!
God, is she beautiful...!

885
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.217
- I mean, she looks OK.
- And the Minister?

886
01:08:13.467 --> 01:08:16.300
He's fine, he's fine.
He's getting some exercise...

887
01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:25.883
Now that we know where they are,
maybe we should try and get them back?

888
01:08:26.133 --> 01:08:29.217
I've got an idea.
We must warn your friend somehow.

889
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.633
- Won't be easy... hold on, I'm such a jerk!
- Oh? Really?

890
01:08:33.717 --> 01:08:36.133
Her earphone!
Maybe she kept her earphone!

891
01:08:36.967 --> 01:08:39.467
Petra! Petra!

892
01:08:41.467 --> 01:08:44.717
Are you ready to kill?

893
01:08:45.217 --> 01:08:46.550
You hear me? Petra?

894
01:08:50.883 --> 01:08:53.217
Petra, we're not far away.
I can see you.

895
01:08:54.133 --> 01:08:59.883
Now get up, and turn around!

896
01:09:02.967 --> 01:09:05.717
Petra, get up, I need to see your hands!

897
01:09:10.633 --> 01:09:13.883
- What's going on here?
- I'm not doing anything!

898
01:09:13.967 --> 01:09:16.467
- Idiot!
- Liar!

899
01:09:16.883 --> 01:09:18.383
Sit down. We're coming.

900
01:09:18.967 --> 01:09:20.216
We're coming... that's easy to say!

901
01:09:20.217 --> 01:09:21.467
Don't worry, I got a plan.

902
01:09:21.717 --> 01:09:23.383
That's exactly what worries me!

903
01:09:24.133 --> 01:09:29.050
You hear only what I tell you...

904
01:09:29.467 --> 01:09:32.967
You obey me!

905
01:09:37.467 --> 01:09:41.300
You do only what I tell you...

906
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:45.050
You obey me!

907
01:09:47.133 --> 01:09:50.300
And now...

908
01:09:51.217 --> 01:09:59.883
I wanna go home 'cause it's too
cold here and I'm getting sick and...

909
01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:07.800
You're going to sleep.

910
01:10:11.383 --> 01:10:13.383
Raise your arms.

911
01:10:19.467 --> 01:10:23.717
Con-nichon-aah!
Hey, it's my turn now! Come on!

912
01:10:24.133 --> 01:10:26.467
I'm not bad at hypnosis!

913
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.300
Sit! Good boy!

914
01:10:29.467 --> 01:10:33.717
Now lie down! Very, very good!

915
01:10:33.883 --> 01:10:35.883
And now... sleep!

916
01:10:38.883 --> 01:10:42.382
Freeze or you'll sleep too, and for long!
OK?

917
01:10:42.383 --> 01:10:44.633
OK, I'll cover you.

918
01:10:49.633 --> 01:10:51.883
Hey, girls, what're you doing?

919
01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.300
No need. I had'em covered.

920
01:11:42.467 --> 01:11:43.967
It's not loaded, Émilien.

921
01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:45.550
What'd you mean, it's not loaded?

922
01:11:46.925 --> 01:11:47.800
How come?

923
01:11:50.217 --> 01:11:53.300
It was me. I emptied the clip yesterday.

924
01:11:54.883 --> 01:11:58.633
So... it was never loaded?

925
01:11:59.717 --> 01:12:01.508
I was worried you'd get hurt...

926
01:12:25.133 --> 01:12:27.383
I'm very late, can you save my life?

927
01:12:31.633 --> 01:12:33.800
Err... don't worry, I'll manage.

928
01:12:36.425 --> 01:12:39.467
- C'mon, jump in there!
- What...? Are you sure?

929
01:13:01.633 --> 01:13:03.425
Catch those clowns!

930
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.967
Fancy some sushi?

931
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:34.300
There's no exit, Daniel!

932
01:14:06.133 --> 01:14:07.800
They're after you, Daniel!

933
01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.300
That's one less!

934
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:26.383
We'll get off at the next station...

935
01:14:47.467 --> 01:14:49.883
We're too heavy. And they got good cars!

936
01:14:50.133 --> 01:14:52.800
Ask your Paris colleagues to help out.

937
01:14:52.842 --> 01:14:54.633
Forget it. Cops from Paris
and Marseille are at war.

938
01:14:54.717 --> 01:14:55.633
They'll never help us.

939
01:14:55.717 --> 01:14:56.633
Aww, you just never asked 'em politely!

940
01:14:58.883 --> 01:14:59.883
Daniel, what the...?

941
01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.967
So, dickheads, you're not at the parade?
Soldiers ain't your thing?

942
01:15:17.133 --> 01:15:20.050
You'd rather stay home and gobble knobs?

943
01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:24.633
How 'bout a love parade?
Let him who loves me, follow me!

944
01:15:31.383 --> 01:15:32.717
I think you went a bit far!

945
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.508
Aww, don't worry, I'm sure they loved that!

946
01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:41.300
Catch that asshole, ALIVE!
I'll blast him to hell myself!

947
01:15:57.050 --> 01:15:59.133
Where are you?

948
01:16:01.217 --> 01:16:03.467
Where is "Trocadéro"?

949
01:16:03.883 --> 01:16:05.883
Well, you must change at Châtelet!

950
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.508
A bus, Daniel!

951
01:16:39.092 --> 01:16:41.175
Oh, the Eiffel Tower!

952
01:16:49.633 --> 01:16:52.092
Stay off the grass!

953
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:08.258
- It's straight ahead now!
- OK!

954
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.882
Where'd that one come from?

955
01:17:14.883 --> 01:17:17.133
Yes. Get the taxi!

956
01:17:19.217 --> 01:17:20.758
- Kamikaze!
- Kamika what?

957
01:17:22.217 --> 01:17:23.717
Kamikaze...?!!

958
01:17:29.383 --> 01:17:30.883
BANZAI...!

959
01:18:44.717 --> 01:18:47.217
Shit... I can't shake 'em!
We're too heavy!

960
01:18:47.467 --> 01:18:48.383
I can get out, if you want!

961
01:18:48.467 --> 01:18:51.133
- Bad idea Émilien, try harder!
- I can't!

962
01:18:55.050 --> 01:18:57.383
- Call the General!
- OK. General, do you copy?

963
01:18:57.592 --> 01:19:00.800
Loud 'n' clear!
How's your Paris tour going?

964
01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:02.633
It's whizzing by!

965
01:19:02.883 --> 01:19:07.508
Tell him to block the Dauphine tunnel exit.
We'll set up a trap there!

966
01:19:07.883 --> 01:19:09.383
No problem. Give me 5 minutes!

967
01:19:10.633 --> 01:19:11.966
Yes, hello?

968
01:19:11.967 --> 01:19:14.466
Picard? Bertineau here!

969
01:19:14.467 --> 01:19:15.716
General, sir!

970
01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:18.133
You got a spare tank or two?

971
01:19:19.217 --> 01:19:20.550
As a matter of fact, yes...

972
01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:24.800
We're almost there, he'd better hurry!

973
01:19:36.967 --> 01:19:39.467
Dammit, what's taking him so long?

974
01:19:41.425 --> 01:19:44.216
Roger sir, we're in position.
The tunnel is blocked.

975
01:19:44.217 --> 01:19:46.883
- 4 mins, 32 seconds.
- Well done, sir!

976
01:19:47.217 --> 01:19:48.383
Hang on!

977
01:19:54.383 --> 01:19:56.299
I don't wanna play after all!

978
01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:58.216
You'd rather stop and get shot down?

979
01:19:58.217 --> 01:20:00.883
No but I don't wanna hit a tank, either!

980
01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:05.300
Daniel, now that I found Petra again
I'd like to enjoy it before I die!

981
01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.967
Don't worry.
I'm taking you straight to Heaven!

982
01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:12.592
But I wanna stay
right here on Earth, Daniel!

983
01:20:54.133 --> 01:20:55.467
You scared the bejesus outta me again!

984
01:20:56.342 --> 01:20:58.925
Maybe one day, you'll trust me!

985
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:07.133
The Minister says you're wonderful. He'd
like you to become his driver in Japan.

986
01:21:07.633 --> 01:21:11.717
Thanks, maybe later.
But right now, I wanna go home!

987
01:21:12.008 --> 01:21:15.883
Yeah, we're going home, Daniel.
Can we drop you off somewhere?

988
01:21:21.633 --> 01:21:22.799
Oh no, not the TV!

989
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.883
Just 5 minutes, it's the parade...
I want to see your father.

990
01:21:35.133 --> 01:21:38.550
Oh...? It looks like Daniel's taxi!
Ain't that funny?

991
01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:48.133
Émilien?!

992
01:21:58.883 --> 01:22:02.800
Well, err... that's something brand new.

993
01:22:03.217 --> 01:22:04.883
A... stealth taxi.

994
01:22:07.133 --> 01:22:11.925
I'll drop you at the grandstand and I'll run, ok?
I don't like this place... it freaks me out.

995
01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:13.925
Émilien...
