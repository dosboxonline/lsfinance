<p>JSON stands for <b>J</b>ava<b>S</b>cript <b>O</b>bject <b>N</b>otation and is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. It should be relatively \"self-describing\" and easy to understand[@@https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp].</p>

<p>JSON files are organised in comma separated name/value pairs held within curly brackets, with additional non-named lists held within square brackets. It is also important to ensure that none of the names or values include any newline characters or special JSON characters. There are a large number of websites describing all of the details and rules of the JSON format, but unless you would really like to learn there is a simple solution. If in doubt just copy and paste you name or value text into an online JSON formatting tool and let it do the work[@@https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character] for you, then copy the processed text into your file and move on.</p>

<p>There are many of these tools online, such as:/p>

<li>[codebeautify.org|https://codebeautify.org/json-escape-unescape]</li>

</ul>

      ]

<p>In addition to ensuring that individual name of value texts are correctly processed it is also common, when editing an existing JSON file to make small errors, forgetting a comma, or a double quotes, etc. If your files start to get longer it is often useful just to check that your file is still a valid JSON file before submitting it. As with the escape process above there are a number of free online tools to do this, such as:</p>

	<li>[www.freeformatter.com|https://www.freeformatter.com/json-validator.html]</li>
	<li>Or simply explore [Google|https://www.google.com/search?q=validate+json].</li>
</ul>
